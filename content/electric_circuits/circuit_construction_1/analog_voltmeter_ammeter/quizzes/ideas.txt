A person builds the following circuit in an attempt to measure the CURRENT through the resistor indicated,
but it does not seem to be working properly. What does the builder need to do to fix the setup

What does the circuit builder need to do to fix this setup?
- the setup is a short circuit, take it down immediately and reconnect the elements correctly
- the ammeter needs to be replaced by an ammeter with a higher maximum value
- the ammeter needs to be replaced by an ammeter with a lower maximum value
- reverse the direction of the ammeter


Photo of an ammeter in parallel with a current greater than 1 A.
- Is this working correctly?
- yes, the current measured is X amps
- no! that current is way to high, the circuit must be wired incorrectly

What is your best measurement of the resistance indicated below?


A voltmeter set up in series:
- and some things about it????



Someone is attempting to measure the voltage across a resistor and the current through that resistor.
Which of the following diagrams below shows a correctly connected ammeter and voltmeter?
