In a typical electric circuit, what does the mathematical quantity "current" represent?
- positive charge moving, which is caused by electrons flowing in the direction opposite the current
- negative charge moving, caused by electrons moving in the direction of the current.
- negative charge moving, which is caused by protons flowing in the direction opposite the current
- positive charge moving, caused by protons moving in the direction of the current.

Why are electrons negative and protons positive?
- the first person to seriously study electricity dictated that negative charges moved. For extra credit, please deliver to Mr. Kuncik a large stack of portraits of this individual.


Current has to flow all the way from the battery to a light bulb,
but when a switch is closed, the light bulb lights instantly. Why?
- The electrons arrive from the battery at the speed of light.
- The battery pushes electrons that are already located in the light bulb's filament.
- The electrons are moving very fast, but not at light speed. If the wire was longer, you would see a delay.

True or false: The electric wire is negatively charged when a current flows through it.
Chose the BEST option that has the correct answer and a correct explanation.
[2 parts, a theory part and an observation part]

-False: we can tell the wire is uncharged because it does not exhibit the same phenomena as charged objects
-True: If you touch a wire, you are shocked, so it must be negatively charged.
-True: The wire is negatively charged, but you can't tell because it is a very weak current. You could better observe the charge on a large transmission wire.


-True: electrons are moving through the wire, so it must be negatively charged
-False: The wire is not charged because the battery sends both protons and electrons through the wire.
-False: The wire is not charged because the electrons that create the current were already in the wire.
[2 correct answers]
[too much in one question??/ should i split it into two, one that deals with observation and the other that deals with theory]


Birds can land on a transmission wire and not be fried. Why?
[add photo]
- When landing on a single wire, the birds do not complete a circuit.
- Transformers regulate voltage and current in transmission wires so that birds are safe
- The birds feet act as insulators.
- Birds have a natural resistance to electricity, other animals would be fried.
- The wires have alternating current, which is safe. If it was direct current, the bird would be fried.
