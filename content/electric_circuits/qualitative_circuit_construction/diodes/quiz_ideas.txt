=> include a resistor color chart on the quiz

Pictures of broken circuits they need to troubleshoot  [7 questions]
- diode connected incorrectly [long prong towards positive end]
- no resistor
- too large a resistor (identify by colors)
- correctly wired circuit
- breadboard connected incorrectly
- resistor and LED in parallel

Choices Options:
- The LED will light correctly. [have pictures in which the LED lights correctly]
- The LED will not light because the resistor used is a poor choice
- No current will flow because the breadboard is connected incorrectly and the circuit is not complete? [make sure this is unambiguous]
- The LED will light, but the circuit is a short circuit [two of these, one with no resistor and one with a resistor in parallel]
- The LED will not light because it is oriented incorrectly


Questions about the official circuit diagram symbols.


- there should be a few breadboard arrangement questions, because that is a big part of the lab


Conceptual questions:
Other than making a fun light, what is the purpose of a diode?
- a diode ensures that current travels only one way


How does the  an LED differ a lightbulb? [add this to the pod page as well]
- a light bulb emits all wavelenghts [white light], an LED emits a single wavelength
- An incandescent light bulb becomes warm, an LED does not
- an incandescent light bulb provides resistance, an LED does not
- an incandescent light bulb is non-polar, and LED is polar [i think that is the correct terminology, check to make sure)
