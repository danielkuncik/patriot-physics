New Ideas =>

I think that i need to split this unit into
'qualitative circuit construction'
and
'quantitative circuit construction'


New ideas for 'qualitative circuit construction'
- qualitative diodes
- using a dc power supply?
[how could i bring this up to higher levels???]

New ideas for 'quantitative circuit construction'
= measuring internal resistance
resistors 3 => achieving a desired value of current
- quantitative LEDs => the diode has a specified voltage and no resistance, you add a resistor to set the current (and therefore power) that you want
- connecting voltmeters and ammeters to measure current or voltage in specific parts of a circuit
