<p class = 'introduction'>
    When building simple electric circuits, you often come across a few unpleasant surprises.
    Sometimes, you have a circuit that just does not seem to work, but does get very hot to the touch.
    Other times, you may find that adding a wire shuts off a light bulb.
    What is going on here? Most likely, you are creating <strong>short circuits</strong>
    or circuits with very little resistance.
    These circuits will not work properly, and due to very high current, will begin to overheat.
</p>

<p class="introduction">
    Short circuits can be extremely dangerous!
    However, as long as you are building with only simple batteries, wires, and light bulbs,
    nothing bad is going to happen. Therefore, it is useful to spend some time
    intentionally building short circuits to see how they work.

                    A <strong>short circuit</strong> is a circuit that includes no resistance.
                    Short circuits are dangerous, but also very interesting, and sometimes counterintuitive.
                    To learn about short circuits, we are going to build some short circuits using
                    only one battery. Don't worry, as long as we use only one battery, nobody will get hurt,
                    and this is a good way to build and play around with short circuits without the danger.

                <h4>
                    Procedure
                </h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Put the battery in the holder and connect one end of the battery
                        to the other, without including any light bulb in between, only a wire:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'shortCircuit1'></div>
                        <br>
                        This is a short circuit! That is because there is a working circuit, but there is no resistor (like a light bulb in the circuit)
                        Wait for a few minutes, and the battery might become a little bit warm.
                        After this happens, disconnect the circuit!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is there electric current running in your short circuit?
                        How can you tell?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Short circuits are dangerous because, with no resistance, there is a very high amount of current!
                        Remember, \( V = IR \) and \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), so if \( R \) is very low,
                        then \( I \) is very high.
                        People often believe that high voltage is very dangerous, but it is actually high current that tends to make
                        danger. When there is high current is when you start to feel your circuit get warm.
                        In fact, most household items can take only about 15 amps before they break.
                        <br>
                        Look at the voltage of your battery. If the wire provides only 0.1 Ohms of resistance,
                        find the <emph>current</emph> and <emph>power</emph> of your circuit with the formula
                        \( V = IR \).
                        Based on the information above, is this safe? [Don't worry, I made up these numbers..it doesn't actually have that much current in reality.]

                        <strong>Shorting a Light Bulb:</strong>
                        Connect a light bulb to a battery so that it lights:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'simpleCircuit1'></div>
                        <br>
                        Now, add another wire between your bulb and battery like so:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'shortCircuit2'></div>
                        <br>
                        What happens to the light bulb the moment you add the wire?
                        Wait for a few minutes again and see if the battery becomes warm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Imagine that the wire is a big open highway, the light bulb (a resistor)
                        is a traffic jam, and the electrons (moving around the circuit) are cars trying to
                        get from one end of the battery to the other.
                        Which path would the electrons take, the path with the light bulb or the path without the light bulb?
                        Based on this metaphor, why do you think the light bulb shuts off when another line opens up?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A "Short Circuit" that is a Long Circuit:</strong>
                        Connect a light bulb to a battery so that it lights:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'simpleCircuit2'></div>
                        <br>
                        Now, add another wire that goes the long around the light bulb:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'shortCircuit3'></div>
                        <br>
                        What happens to the light bulb? Wait a few minutes again and see if the battery becomes warm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A short circuit always happens because there is a path around the light bulb that includes no resistance.
                        It does not matter if this path is short or long. Wires have almost no resistance, so if there are lots
                        of wires, it can still be a 'short' circuit.
                        Using the same explanation you had above, explain why the light bulb turns off,
                        even though the path through the wire is much longer than the path through the light bulb.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your friend builds this circuit:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'shortCircuit4'></div>
                        <br>
                        Upon noticing the light bulb does not light, your friend says
                        "The light bulb does not light because it is farther away from the battery than the other wire."
                        Is your friend correct?
                        If not, create a 'counterexample,' that is, draw another circuit which you can use to prove that
                        his reasoning is incorrect. Explain what happens when you build your counterexample
                    </li>

                            Explain why by referring to what you found in previous questions.

                            <strong>Shorting a Light Bulb:</strong>
                            Connect a light bulb to a battery so that it lights:
                            <br>
                            <div id = 'simpleCircuit1_1'></div>
                            <br>
                            Now, add another wire between your bulb and battery like so:
                            <br>
                            <div id = 'shortCircuit2_1'></div>
                            <br>
                            What happens to the light bulb the moment you add the wire?
                            Wait for a few minutes again and see if the battery becomes warm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Imagine that the wire is a big open highway, the light bulb (a resistor)
                            is a traffic jam, and the electrons (moving around the circuit) are cars trying to
                            get from one end of the battery to the other.
                            Which path would the electrons take, the path with the light bulb or the path without the light bulb?
                            Based on this metaphor, why do you think the light bulb shuts off when another line opens up?

                            <strong>A "Short Circuit" that is a Long Circuit:</strong>
                            Connect a light bulb to a battery so that it lights:
                            <br>
                            <div id = 'simpleCircuit2_1'></div>
                            <br>
                            Now, add another wire that goes the long around the light bulb:
                            <br>
                            <div id = 'shortCircuit3_1'></div>
                            <br>
                            What happens to the light bulb? Wait a few minutes again and see if the battery becomes warm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A short circuit always happens because there is a path around the light bulb that includes no resistance.
                            It does not matter if this path is short or long. Wires have almost no resistance, so if there are lots
                            of wires, it can still be a 'short' circuit.
                            Using the same explanation you had above, explain why the light bulb turns off,
                            even though the path through the wire is much longer than the path through the light bulb.

                            Upon noticing the light bulb does not light, your friend says
                            "The light bulb does not light because it is farther away from the battery than the other wire."

                        This is a short circuit! Short circuits are dangerous. How does the simulation represent this?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is there electric current running in your short circuit?
                        Is it a high or a low current?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Short circuits are dangerous because, with no resistance, there is a very high amount of current!
                        Remember, \( V = IR \) and \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), so if \( R \) is very low,
                        then \( I \) is very high.
                        People often believe that high voltage is very dangerous, but it is actually high current that tends to make
                        danger. When there is high current is when you start to feel your circuit get warm.
                        In fact, most household items can take only about 15 amps before they break.
                        <br>
                        Look at the voltage of your battery. If the wire provides only 0.1 Ohms of resistance,
                        find the <emph>current</emph> and <emph>power</emph> of your circuit with the formula
                        \( V = IR \).
                        Based on the information above, is this safe? [Do note that I made up these numbers..it doesn't actually have that much current in reality.]
