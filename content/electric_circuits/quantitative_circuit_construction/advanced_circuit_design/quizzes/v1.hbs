You need to create a circuit with three devices
Device 1 requires a current of xxx
Device 2 requires a current of yyy
Device 3 requires a current of zzz

you have the following resistors: You do not need to use them all
(long list)

you also have aaa D batteries. you do not need to use every battery in creating your circuit
Assume that the internal resistance of each battery is www.

You have four switches and a fuse

Create a circuit in which each device receives within 1% of the correct current listed.

Connect a switch that controls each device individually and another switch that controls the entire circuit.
Connect the fuse to protect the entire circuit.
