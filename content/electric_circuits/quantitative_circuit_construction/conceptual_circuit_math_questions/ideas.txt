I really want a pod (probably level 3, that asks conceptual questions related to electric circuit math?)



A battery is connected to a ressitor.
The person intends to add a second resistor in _parallel_.
how will this affect the ressitance of the circuit

a. the resistance will increase because another resistor was added
b. the resistor will stay the same because the resistors are in parallel
c. the resistance will decrease because another path was added for current to travel
d. the resistance will .....

(or just, to have the answer minus the explanations?)


electric circuit designers typically have a large collection of many resistors of many different resistances. why?
a. selecting a resistor allows the designer to determine what current will flow under a specified voltage.
