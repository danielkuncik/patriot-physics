An entire ladder on how to use force meters, and on things that can be learned by using force meters



- a pod on how to select the correct meter for the job

- a pod on reasonable assessments of forces

(eg. lifting your backpack should take about how much force?
A. 0.5 N
B. 30 N
C. 400 N
D. 8000 N
)

- a pod on how force meters actually work
(a level 2, on how the spring scales work??)


- balances vs. spring scales

- force meters in an elevator (a higher level)

- force meters in circular motion

- building your own force meter

- force meters on accelrating objects (if you are pulling on an object taht accelerates, how does it actually feel?)
