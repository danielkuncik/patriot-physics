The following rules determine the elevator:

Velocity:
The vector will point the direction that the elevator is traveling.

Acceleration:
The elevator is speeding up => points in the SAME direction as velocity
The elevator is slowing down => points in the OPPOSITE direction as velocity.
The elevator is moving at a constant velocity => acceleration is zero

Net force on the person:
The vector will always be in the same direction as acceleration.
(By Newtonâ€™s Second Law!)


Free-Body Diagram:
The Free-Body Diagram contains two vectors: gravity downwards and normal force upwards.

Force of Gravity on the person:
This will be downward and have the same magnitude, regardless of situation.

Normal Force on the person:
The direction will always be upwards. The magnitude will be such that Normal Force + Gravity = Net force.


Feeling:
The feeling of the person will be:
If normal force is less than gravity => weightlessness
If normal force is greater than gravity => heaviness
If normal force equals gravity => typical

Equivalently:
Net force is downwards => weightlessness
Net force is upwards => heaviness
Net force is zero (constant velocity) => typical


Note that at points A and D are intuitive: the feelings of the person match what is actually happening, whereas points C and E are counterintuitive; the feelings of the person are the opposite of what is happening.
