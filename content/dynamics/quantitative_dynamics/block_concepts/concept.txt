This pod will discuss the conceptual reasoning behind problems involving blocks.


1. A student receives the following problem.
"A 2 kg block is moving to the right on a surface. It is being pulled to the right with a force of 10 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface is 0.2. Determine the acceleration of the block."
The student does the following first:
F_g = m * g = 2 * 9.81 = 19.62 N
F_N = 19.62 N
Did the student determine normal force correctly?
A. Yes, normal force is always equal to gravity.
B. Yes, normal force is equal to gravity in this situation.
D. No, the normal force is not equal to gravity.
E. The teacher miswrote the question, more information is needed to find the normal force.


2. "A 2 kg block is on a frictionless surface. It is being pulled to the right with a force of 10 N. Determine the acceleration of the block."
Which of the following statements is true regarding the velocity of the block?
A. The block's velocity is irrelevant to the problem. (correct)
B. The problem cannot be accurately solved because the teacher did not include enough information on the block's velocity.
C. The block is moving at a constant velocity.
D. The block is moving to the right.

3. "A 2 kg block is moving on a surface. It is being pulled to the right with a force of 10 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface is 0.2. Determine the acceleration of the block." (very hard!)
Which of the following statements is true regarding the velocity of the block?
A. The block's velocity is irrelevant to the problem.
B. The problem cannot be accurately solved because the teacher did not include enough information on the block's velocity. (correct)
C. The block is moving at a constant velocity.
D. The block is moving to the right.
