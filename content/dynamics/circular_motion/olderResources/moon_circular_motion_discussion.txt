This discussion is a first-day discussion on circular motion,
the goal is to create a logically consistent theory that explains why the moon is orbiting the earth.
Law of universal gravitation is a prequisite; so is Newton's Model for 1-D motion

Students receive in information sheet with mass objects in the solar system,
mass of other objects, distances

Newton's Laws written out clearly (including implications of the third law),
law of universal gravitation (maybe)

We assume the earth is moving in a circle at a constatn velocity with radisu (average of perigee and apogee).

Students answer a series of qualitative and quantitative discussion questions to this end.

Question 1: By referring to Newton's Laws of Motion, determine if the net force acting on the moon is zero or not zero.
(not zero)

Question 2: If the nt force is not zero, some force must acto n the mooon, determine what this force is:
type of force - magnitude - direction - agent - object

Question 3: If there is one force, according to Newton's Third Law, there must be a pair.
Determine the pair:
type of force- magnitude - direciton -agent - object

Quesiton 4: Draw a Free-body diagram of the earht and moon (ignore forces outside the earth-moon system)

Question 5: Is the second force on the list important ?
(yes, it causes the tides)

Question 6: Draw diagram of the moon at some point in its orbit
Take origin to be the center of the earth
Determine QUALitative vectors for the position, velocity, acceleraiton, and net force of the moon
Demonstrate these vectors are consistent with Newton's Second Law.

Question 7: Determine qualitative values for position, velocity, acceleration, and net force

Question 8: New Rule Presented:
the magnitude of acceleration of an object moving in a circle at a constant speed is speed^2 / radius of the circle
- demonstrate this formula is dimensionally correct
- demonstrate that the quantitative kinematic values you determiend for position, velocity, and acceleartion of the moon
are consistent with this new rule


Next Lesson would eb vertical circles and centripetal force
Lesson after that would be to determine the mass of the sun
