What is the correct free-body diagram of the person in the gravitron?



What is the direction of the normal force acting on the person?
- towards the center of the circle, because that is the direction perpendicular to the surface of the wall
- upwards, because that is always the direction of th enormal force on a planet
- upwards, because the normal force is always in the direction opposite the force of gravity
- outwards from the center of the circle, because the person is beign pressed into the wall


What is the direction of the gravitational force acting on the person?
- towards the center of the circle
- upwards
- outwards from the center of the circle
- downwards


What is the direction of the frictional force
- downwards, to supplement gravity
- upwards, to resist motion
inwards, because it is the centripetal force
outwards, to keep the person from falling off the ride

Which type of frictional force is applied
- kinetic, because the person is moving in a circle
- static, because the person is not sliding
- kinetic, because the person is moving


if the person is not falling down, what is the magnitude of the friction force?
- equal to the magnitude of the normal force times the coefficient of friction
equal the the gravitational force
- equal to the centripetal force
