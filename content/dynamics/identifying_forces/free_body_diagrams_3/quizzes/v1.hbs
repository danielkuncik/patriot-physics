<p class = 'directions'>
    A person pushes a box to the LEFT on a surface that includes friction.
    The box is moving at a <emph>constant velocity</emph>,
    and thus a net force of zero acts on on both the box and the person.
    Draw free-body diagrams of the person, the earth, the box, and the floor.
    For full credit, you <strong>must</strong> distinguish between static and kinetic friction
    and write the full name of each force.

    Your score on this quiz will be based primarily on how well you answer the final question.
    The questions before are worth less, but you must answer them correctly
    in order to set up the final question.
    <strong>DO NOT</strong> change the order of forces that are indicated in the tables provided,
    you need to use the letters provided in the spaces they are provided to earn a perfect score.
    (If people changed the order of forces, grading this quiz would become impractical.)
