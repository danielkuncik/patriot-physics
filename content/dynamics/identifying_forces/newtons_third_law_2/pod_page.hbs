    In a previous pod, we learned the basics of Newton's Third Law.
    In this pod, we will look more at how it applies to real life situations.

  Whenever A exerts a force on B,
  then B exerts a force on A
  with equal magnitude and opposite direction.
  These two forces are called an <em>action-reaction pair</em>.

<h4>
  Rigorously Describing Reaction Forces
</h4>

<p>
  Newton's Third Law states that two forces always come in <strong>pairs</strong>,
  which are called <em>action-reaction pairs</em>.
</p>

<ul class="definition" data-word = 'reaction force'>
    <li>
        The <em>agent</em> of the reaction force is the object of the original force.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>object</em> of the reaction force is the agent of the original force.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>magnitude</em> of the reaction force is the same as the magnitude of the original force.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>direction</em> of the reaction force is opposite the direction of the original force.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The rocket pushes hot air downward, and the reaction force pushes the rocket upward:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The agent of the reaction force is the hot air.
    </li>
    <li>
        The object of the reaction force is the rocket.
    </li>
    <li>
        The direction of the reaction force is upward.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    And that makes the rocket move upward!

    Reaction Force of Gravity

<h4>
  An Advanced Point
</h4>

<p>
  Newton's Third Law states that forces always come in pairs.
  Even though we call them "action-reaction pairs",
  it is important to note that there aren't really two different forces,
  one "action" and another "reaction."
  What's really happening is that two forces occur simultaneously all of the time:
  whenever there is one force, there is always another.
  One force didn't come first and the other second;
  whenever there is one force, the other is there, always.
</p>

<p>
  We call then an "action-reaction pair" because those are the words that Isaac Newton used,
  and the term is intuitive, but that isn't really correct!
  They are simply a pair of forces that exist together.
