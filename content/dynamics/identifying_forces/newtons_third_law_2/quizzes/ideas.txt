Newton's Third Law states that every force is accompanied by a reaction force:
If I punch a punching bag with 300 N of force, the reaction-force exerts 300 N on my hand.
Which of the following is true:
A. the reaction force occurs about half a second after I punch the bag
B. the reaction force occurs about 2 microseconds after I punch the bag
C. the reaction force occurs about 1 nanosecond after I punch the bag
D. the reaction force occurs simultaneously


Some physicists and physics teachers believe that forces should not be called "action-reaction pairs"
but "interaction pairs." Why might this wording be more accurate?
A. The phrase "action-reaction pair" implies one force causes the other, when in fact they exist as a simultaneous pair.
B.
