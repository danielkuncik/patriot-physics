1.
a = g ( sin (theta) - mu_k * cos(theta) )


2.
differences =>
kinetic friction is now down the ramp, in the same direction as Fg_x

a = g ( sin (theta) + mu_k * cos(theta) )

- The block is slowing down because its acceleration/net force and velocity are in opposite directions


Draw a free-body diagram and determine the direction of acceleration.
Determine the magnitude of acceleration.
Determine if the block is speeding up, slowing down, or moving at a constant speed and describe briefly how your know.
Give a brief description of a time that this might be the case.
