<p>
    In previous pods, we learned to use the four
    kinematic equations, which can
    be used whenever acceleration is constant.
    In this pod, we will apply these equations to stepwise motion.
    In stepwise motion, acceleration is not constant for the entire motion,
    but it is constant in a series of small steps.
    This means that you can use the kinematic equations,
    but their usage gets much more complicated
</p>

<h5>
    Which Equations to Use
</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        For any section in which an object is either
        speeding up or slowing down,
        you need to use the four kinematic equations:
        <br>
        <div id = 'kinematicEquationsTable'></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        However, there are also intervals when an
        object is moving at a constant velocity.
        In these intervals, use a much simpler formula
        for constant velocity motion:
        $$
        \Delta x = v t
        $$
    </li>
    <li>
        There may also be steps of motion
        when an object is not moving at all.
        In these steps of motion, \( \Delta x = 0 \).
    </li>
</ul>

        <strong>[4 steps]:</strong>
        You are driving towards a green light at a speed of 25 m/s.
        But after 3 seconds, the light ahead of you turns red,
        and you begin slowing to a stop. You stop at the light after 4 seconds.
        You wait for 10 seconds.
        Then, the light turns green, and you begin accelerating at a rate of 4 m/s,<sup>2</sup>,
        until you reach 25 m/s again. You then travel another 3 seconds at a constant speed.

        For this entire trip, what is your <emph>average speed</emph>?
        <p>
            Use this method:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the table below, find the distance and time of each step, then use the
                formula for average speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember that the <emph>final</emph> velocity for one step is equal to the <emph>initial</emph> velocity
                of the next step!

        <strong>The Bike Race:</strong> (This problem is tougher
        than those that will be on the miniquiz):
        Jonny and Joey are in a bicycle race.
        Joey is biking consistently forward at a rate of 15 m/s.
        Jonny is moving at the same speed as Joey but is behind by 60 meters.
        This persists for 30 seconds.
        Then, Jonny decides to catch up.
        He accelerates at a constant rate for a time of 10 seconds, after which he is moving 5 m/s faster than Joey.
        Then, he bikes at this speed until he is 20 m ahead of Joey.
        Over the course of the next 40 m, Jonny decelerates to 15 m/s, his original speed.
        Fortunately, Joey is completely exhausted and unable to catch up!
        Jonny easily wins moving at a constant velocity for the final 200 m of the race.
