<p about="definition" data-word = 'circle'>
    A <strong>circle</strong> is defined as all points equidistant from a single point.
    The single point is called the <emph>center</emph>, and the distance from that point is called the <emph>radius</emph>.
</p>

<ul class = 'definition' data-word = 'ellipse'>
    <li>
        An <strong>ellipse</strong> is a shape that looks like a stretched out circle.
    </li>
    <li>
        An ellipse is defined as all points for whom the sum of the distance from two points,
        called the <emph>foci</emph> is the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        The distance between the two foci is called the <strong>eccentricity</strong> of an ellipse
        The farther apart the foci are, the more the elongated the ellipse is.
        The closer together the foci are, the more circular the ellipse is.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>
    Orbit Vocabulary
</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Aphelion:</strong> the point at which a planet is furthest from the sun
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Perihelion:</strong> The point at which the planet is closest to the sun.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Foci:</strong> Two points that define an ellipse. The ellipse is all points for which
        the sum of the distance from the foci is identical.
        The sun is located at one of the two foci.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Eccentricity</strong>:
        \( \frac{\text{Distance Between the foci}}{\text{Distance between perihelion and aphelion}} \)
        The eccentricity is always between 0 and 1.
        An ellipse with eccentricity zero is a circle.
        The higher the eccentricity becomes, the more elongated an ellipse is.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Orbital Period</strong>: The for a full orbit.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Elliptical Orbits
</h4>

<p class = 'definition' data-word = "Kepler's First Law">
    All bodies orbiting the sun do so in an ellipse, with the sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse.
</p>
<p class = 'definition' data-word = "Kepler's Second Law (Adapted)">
    When a body in an elliptical orbit is far away from the sun, it moves slowly.
    When it comes near the sun, it moves much faster.
</p>

<h5>
    Some Guidelines
</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        The eight planets have ellipses that are nearly circular.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dwarf planets have more elliptical orbits. They remain in a location called the Kuiper belt,
        and then come near the sun.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comets have the most highly elliptical orbits.
        They remain in a far away location for the Oort Cloud for many years, and then swing quickly around
        the sun for a very short time.
        This is why we can see comets for a few weeks, then not see them again for many years.

</ul>
