  <strong>Rebecca:</strong><br>
  I never told you about the letter Jane Crofut got
  from her minister when she was sick.
  He wrote Jane a letter and on the envelope
  the address was like this: It said:
  Jane Crofut; The Crofut Farm; Grover's Corner;
  Sutton County; New Hampshire; United States of America.
  <br>
  <strong>George:</strong><br>
  What's funny about that?
  <br>
  <strong>Rebecca:</strong><br>
  But listen, it's not finished:
  The United States of America;
  Continent of North America;
  Western Hemisphere;
  the Earth;
  the Solar System;
  The Universe;
  The Mind of God&#8212;
  taht's what it said on the envelope.
  <br>
  <strong>George:</strong><br>
  What do you know!
  <br>
  <strong>Rebecca:</strong><br>
  And the postman brough it just the same.
  <br>
  <strong>George:</strong><br>
  What do you know!

<p>
  In this pod, we will consider where you are positioned within the universe.
  People have been wondering this question since the beginning of time,
  and the idea that our place in the Cosmos is a "address" appeared
  briefly in Thorton Wilder's play "Our Town",
  one of the <a href = 'https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/528278/15-remarkable-facts-about-thornton-wilders-our-town'>
  most popular plays</a> in American History.
  Just like you live on a street, which is in a town, which is in a state, which is in a country,
  you live on a planet, which is in a solar system, which is in a galaxy.
</p>

<p>
  Understanding your 'address,' just like Jane Crofut does, is the first step to understanding the whole universe,
  the goal of cosmology!
  Seeing as Jane lived over 100 years ago, we should make some updates for the 21st century.
  So, here is my address:
  My Address is:
  Daniel Kuncik; Room 308; Old Rochester Regional High School; Mattapoisett; Plymouth County; Massachusetts; The United States of America;
  Planet Earth; The Earth-Moon System; The Solar System; The Orion Arm; The Milky Way; The Local Group; The Virgo Supercluster; The Laniakea Supercluster; The Universe

<h4>
  Part 1: Planet Earth
</h4>

<p>
  To start, (almost) all humans live on the planet earth. What does it mean to live on a planet?
</p>

<p class = 'definition' data-word = 'Planet'>
  There are eight planets in our solar system:
  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Juptier, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
  Though there is an
  <a href = 'https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/in-depth/'>official definition of a planet</a>,
  let's focus less on what that is and more on how that came to be.
</p>

<h5>
  A brief history of the definition of planets
</h5>

<p>
  The word "planet" comes from <a href = 'https://www.etymonline.com/word/planet'>the Greek word <em>planetes</em></a>
  for a "wanderer".
  The Greeks saw int he night sky that, unlike the stars, which stayed in the same place each night,
  the bright objects named Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn moved across the night sky each night,
  so they were named "planets" or "wanderers." At this time, nobody considered earth to be a planet!
</p>

<p>
  Over the course of the 16th and 17th century, thanks to the work of astronomers such
  as Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilee, and Johannes Kepler,
  people in Europe came to beleive that earth moved around the sun.
  At this point, the definition of a planet changed (without anyone thinking about it).
  It no longer meant an object moving across the sky, but a large spherical mass moving around the sun.
</p>

<p>
  Later on, three more planets: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were discovered,
  as well as many asteroids, comets, and small objects in the far reaches of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt.
  This raised the question, what really is a <em>planet</em>? Does anything orbitting the sun qualify? Does it need to be big?
  If so, how big?
  Astronomers were discovering "planets" in other solar systems as well.
</p>

<p>
  The issue was brough to a head in the early 2000s, when the Astronomer Mike Brown working at Cal Tech
  discovered a new procedure
  for discvering planets using a technique called interferometery.
  He was soon discovering new "planets" so fast that pretty soon, if astronomers didn't clearly
  draw the line between what was and wasn't a planet, there'd be more planets than preschool children could ever learn!
</p>

<p>
  In the summer of 2006, a truly shocking event occured: the entire world media covered an astronomy conference!
  There, in a contrversial vote, the International Astronomical Union adopted a
  <a href = 'https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/in-depth/'>new definition of a planet</a>
  that would eliminate all of the objects Mike Brown had discovered, and with them, Pluto.
  (which was much smaller and farther away than the other planets).
</p>

<p>
  And why does this matter to cosmology?
  Because we begin our journey on planet earth, know that the term "planet"
  is not a clearly and precisely defined thing,
  but something that has changed in definition over time.
</p>

<h4>
  Part 2: The Earth-Moon System
</h4>

<p>
  Most people assume the next logical step after earth would be to the solar system,
  but let's take a smaller step first to the Earth-Moon System.
</p>

<p class = 'definition' data-word = 'Earth-Moon System'>
  A system consisting of the earth and the moon, considered as a single unit.
</p>

<p>
  When people say "The earth revolves around the sun," they are not wrong,
  but they are incomplete! They should say "The earth-moon system revolves around the sun."
  The center of mass of the earth-moon systm is inside of the earth
  but not at the center (you will learn to calculate its precise location in another pod).
  It is slightly out in the direction of the moon, and because the moon is orbitting,
  the center of mass of the earth-moon system is always changing.
</p>

<p>
  As we will learn when we study the dynamics of systems, a system,
  such as the earth-moon system, can be considered to be a <em>point mass</em> located
  at its center of mass.
  Therefore, if you imagine a single point with the combined mass of the earth and the moon
  orbitting the sun, that is the correct idea.
  Now imagine the earth and the moon existing aroudn that single point.
  That is the earth-moon system.
</p>

<p>
  It's also good to note that the 'earth-moon system' contains many manmade objects orbitting
  the earth, such as the International Space Station and innumerable GPS and communication satellites.
