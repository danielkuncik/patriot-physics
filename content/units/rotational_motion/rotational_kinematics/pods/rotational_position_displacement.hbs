<p>
    When we were learning about linear motion,
    we learned about a series of kinematic quantities,
    such as position, velocity, and acceleration.
    We needed to learn what each quantity meant,
    how to calculate it, and how to interpret it.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we are beginning with rotational kinematics,
    we need to relearn about each of those same quantities.
    Position, velocity, and acceleration still exist in rotational
    motion, but they have new meanings.
    In this first pod, we will learn the definitions
    of rotational position and displacement.

<ul class="definition" data-word = 'Radians'>
    <li>
        Radians are an alternative to degrees used to understand angles.
    </li>
    <li>
        A single revolution around a circle represents 360 degrees or \(2pi \) radians.
    </li>
    <li>
        Half a revolution represents \( \pi \) radians, and a quarter of a revolution
        represents \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="definition" data-word = 'Unit Circle'>
    The <strong>unit circle</strong>
    is a circle with a radius of 1
    used to help understand the meaning of angles.
    To use a unit circle, begin from the +x direction, directly right of the center,
    and move counterclockwise.

<p class="definition" data-word = 'Angular Position'>
    <strong>Angular Position</strong> is given by the position of a rotating
    object on the unit circle, as measured in radians.

<ul>
    <li>
        The positive-x direction, directly to the right of the center of the circle,
        represents angular position zero.
    </li>
    <li>
        As you move counterclockwise through quadrant 1,
        angular position increases to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
    </li>
    <li>
        The positive-y direction, directly up from the center of the circle,
        represents angular position \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
    </li>
    <li>
        As you move counterclockwise through quadrant 2,
        angular position increases to \( \pi \).
    </li>
    <li>
        The negative-x direction, directly left from the center of the circle,
        represents angular position \( \pi \).
    </li>
    <li>
        As you move counterclockwise through quadrant 3,
        angular position increases to \( \frac{3 \pi}{2} \).
    </li>
    <li>
        The negative-y direction, directly down from the center of the circle,
        represents angular position \( \frac{3 \pi}{2} \)
    </li>
    <li>
        As you move counterclockwise through quadrant 4,
        angular position increases to \( 2 \pi \).
    </li>
    <li>
        Angular position cannot be greater than \( 2 \pi \), or a single revolution.
        Once an object crosses the +x direciton, the zero radian line,
        angular position decreases back to zero and begins again.
        (\( 2 \pi = 6.283 \))
    </li>
