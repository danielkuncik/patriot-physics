    In this section we will derive equations for the most common problems
    on the conservation of momentum.
    These equations can be especially helpful for confirming the conservation
    of momentum experimentally.

            Symbolic Explosion Problem
        </h5>
        A cannon of mass \( M_C \) is loaded with a cannonball of mass \( m_b \).
        Initially, they are stationary.
        The cannon fires the cannonball with a velocity \( v_b \),
        and recoils with a velocity \( v_C \).
        Define the direction the cannonball is fired as the positive direction.
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                Derive an equation from the conservation of momentum
                that relates the variables \( M_C \), \( m_b \), \( v_C \), and \( v_b \).
                Do not solve the equation for any particular variable.
                Describe what each term of the equation represents.

            <li>
                The recoil velocity of the cannon should be in the opposite
                direction as the velocity of the cannonball.
                Demonstrate from your formula that this is the case.

                Solve for a new equation that relates the ratio of the speeds
                \( \left| \frac{v_C}{v_b} \right| \)
                to the ratio of the masses \( \frac{M_C}{m_b} \).

            Symbolic Perfectly Inelastic Collision Problem
        </h5>
        A car of mass \( m_a \) is moving at some velocity \( v_{ai} \),
        when it collides with a car of mass \( m_b \) moving at some velocity \( v_{bi} \).
        The two cars stick together and begin moving at a velocity \( v_f \).
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                Use the conservation of momentum to derive an equation that
                relates the variables \( m_a \), \( m_b \), \( v_{ai} \), \( v_{bi} \), and \( v_f \).
                Do not solve your equation for any particular variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                The equation above should have three terms.
                Describe what quantity each term represents.

                The prompt for this problem did not contain any indication
                about which direction the two cars were moving.
                (Other than the implication they are moving in the same dimension.)
                It could have been a rear-end collision or a head-on collision.
                Explain how either condition is represented by the same formula.

            <li>
                Use the equation above to derive a formula for \( v_f \) in terms of
                \( m_a \), \( m_b \), \( v_{ai} \), and \( v_{bi} \).
                Prove your equation is dimensionally correct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assume that the collision is a head-on collision,
                that is, the two cars were moving in opposite directions
                before they collided.
                Without loss of generality, assume that Car A was moving to the right
                and Car B was moving to the left.
                Write an IF-ELSE statement to determine which direct the cars move after
                the collision.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now assume that car B as <emph>stationary</emph> before the collision.
                Modify your equation for \( v_f \) as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the condition that car B was stationary,
                what is the proportionality relationships between \( v_f \)
                and \( v_{ai} \)?
                [under the assumption that \( m_a \) and \( m_b \) are constant variables.]
            </li>
            <li>
                In the condition that car B was stationary,
                describe a proportionality relationship
                between \( v_f \) and some ratio of masses.
                [under the assumption that \( v_{ai} \) is a constant variable.]
