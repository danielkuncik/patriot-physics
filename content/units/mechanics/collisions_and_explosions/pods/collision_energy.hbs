<p>
    In all of the previous sections of this unit,
    we have analyzed only three quantities:
    mass, velocity, and momentum.
    But only other quantity is crucial in understanding momentum: kinetic energy.
</p>

<p>
    The total amount of energy added to the system is the WORK DONE on the system.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If kinetic energy is lost, it is an inelastic collision. (negative work done on the system)
    </li>
    <li>
        If kinetic energy is conserved, it is an elastic collision. (zero work done on the system)
    </li>
    <li>
        If kinetic energy is gained, it is an explosion (positive work done on the system).
    </li>
</ul>

<!--
In each of these problems,
figure out all unknown variables using the conservation of momentum,
then determine how much work was done on the system,
and analyze what force did this work on the system.

                According to the Law of Conservation of Energy,

        A toy car with a mass of 10 kg is moving 5 m/s left
        when it runs into toy truck with a mass of 40 kg
        that was moving 2 m/s to the right.
        A little kid covered the toy truck in flex tape,
        so the two toy cars stick together following the collision.

                According to the Law of Conservation of Energy,
                if energy was lost from the system,
                it needed to become some other form of energy outside
                the system.
                Where did the energy lost from this system go?

                This type of collision, when two objects stick
                together following the collision,
                is called a perfectly inelastic collision.
