<p>
    In the previous section on dragging blocks,
    we considered only an example without friction.
    In this section, on blocks with kinetic friction,
    we will add a fourth force to our free-body diagram.
</p>

<h4>
    Important Rule
</h4>

<p>
    To do the problems in this section, you will need to use Newton's Second Law:
    $$
    \Sigma F = ma
    $$

<h4>
    Forces 1 - 3:

<ul>
    <li>
        Gravity
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <strong>direction</strong> of gravity is always downward.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>magnitude</strong> of gravity
                is given by the formula \( F_g = mg \).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Normal Force
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <strong>direction</strong> of the normal force
                is always perpendicular to the surface,
                which in this case is upward.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>magnitude</strong> of the normal force
                is a very difficult concept. For these problems,
                the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the
                magnitude of gravity.
                (In the elevator problems, it is not!)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Applied Force
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <strong>direction</strong> of the applied force
                is typically given in the problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>magnitude</strong> of the applied force
                is also typically given int he problem.

        </ul>
    </li>

<h4>
    Force 4: Kinetic Friction
</h4>

<p>
    Kinetic friction is a force that acts on anything that is sliding on a surface.
    It is the force that makes moving things difficult.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>magnitude</strong> of kinetic friction
        is given by the formula \( F_{frk} = \mu_k F_N \).
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>direction</strong> of kinetic friction is always
        in the direction opposite the direction
        the box is moving.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class = 'equation'>
    $$
    F_{frk} = \mu_k F_N
    $$
</p>

<div id = 'kineticFrictionFormulaTable'></div>
<p>
    The value \( \mu_k \) is called the coefficient of kinetic friction.
    It is property of the two objects being rubbed together.
    A greater coefficient of kinetic friction indicates that the objects have rougher
    surfaces and thus more friction.
    It is usually a value less than 0.5.
    It is frequently given in the problem, or the goal of the problem is to discover it.
