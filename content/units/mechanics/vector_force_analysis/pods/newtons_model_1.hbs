<h4>
    Interpreting Free-Body Diagrams Using Newton's Model
</h4>
<p class = 'directions'>
    The free-body diagrams below illustrate the force acting on an object.
    For each of the following free-body diagrams,
    information on forces is given as well as information on the velocity of the object.
    Note that velocity is <strong>NOT</strong> a force,
    and this it is indicated separately from the free-body diagram.
    I wrote <i>Newton's Model</i> by compiling Newton's First and Second Laws with the rules of vector addition,
    to create a guide for <strong>qualitatively</strong> relating a free-body diagram to motion.
    Use Newton's Model to predict the motion for each of the free-body diagrams below.
