        Someone fires a bow and arrow across the room to the right.
        At this moment, the arrow has lost contact with the bow,
        and is flying across the room.
        There are two possible free-body diagrams.
        <div id = 'problem1Table'></div>
        Please
    </li>
</ol>


<script>
    let problem1Table = new Table(1,2);
    problem1Table.setColumnProportions([2,2]);

    let choiceA = fastFBD([['down','gravity'],['right','bow force']]);
    let choiceB = fastFBD([['down','gravity']]);
    choiceA.createDiagramObject();
    choiceB.lockRangeToAnotherDiagram(choiceA);
    problem1Table.addDiagramToCell(0,0,choiceA);
    problem1Table.addDiagramToCell(0,1,choiceB);

    $("#problem1Table").append(problem1Table.draw(500));
</script>

<!--
I need to find a way to lock two diagrams together so that they have the same scale.
