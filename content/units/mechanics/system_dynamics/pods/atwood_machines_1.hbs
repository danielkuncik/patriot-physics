                Now, we are going to consider the Atwood Machine as a system,
                in which <emph>both masses</emph> are a part of this system.
                The two free-body diagrams you just drew,

                All four of these forces act on the system, however, they don't all count!

                Newton's Third Law states taht whenever A

                All forces come in pairs, called an "Action-Reaction Force Pair",
                though this is something of a misnomer, because one force
                does not follow the other, but they exist together.
                Demonstrate that the two internal forces to the system
                are an action-reaction force pair.

                This free-body diagram should include <emph>only</emph>
                the external froces.
                However, it is going to be a little different than a typical free-body diagram!
                List one of the forces as "clockwise" and the other force as "counterclockwise,"
                based on which direction they are pulling the system.
                Also identify the agent of each force.

                Identify which of the two forces is the greater one,
                make sure this is represented in your free-body diagram,
                and identify the net force acting on the Atwood machine system.

<h4>
    Quantitative Analysis of an Atwood Machine
</h4>

<p>
    The simplest way to understand an Atwood machine
    quantitatively is as a <emph>full system</emph>.
    In this case, there are only two formulas you need.
</p>

<ul class="principleList">
    <li>
        \( F_g = mg \)
    </li>
    <li>
        The force of gravity (weight) = mass * free-fall acceleration
    </li>
    <li>
        On earth, free-fall acceleration = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul class="principleList">
    <li>
        Newton's Second Law:
    </li>
    <li>
        \( \Sigma F = m a  \)
    </li>
    <li>
        Net Force = mass * acceleration
    </li>
</ul>
