    In dynamics graphs 1,
    we studied the relationship
    between dynamic graphs (momentum and net force graphs)
    and their corresponding kinematic graphs (velocity and acceleration graphs).
    In dynamic graphs 2, we studied the relationship
    between the two dynamic graphs themselves.
    And in previous units on quantitative kinematics,
    we looked at the relationship between the three kinematic graphs.

    In this section, our goal is to put it all together.
    We will establish a full understanding of the relationship amongst
    all five types of kinematic and dynamic graphs.
