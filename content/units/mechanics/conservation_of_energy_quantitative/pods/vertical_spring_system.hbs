    (Note that I chose unrealistic values in order to make the math simpler
    for this problem.)
    A spring hanging vertically has a spring constant of 98 N/m
    and a equilibrium length of 3 m.
    A mass of 10 kg is attached to the end of the spring,
    and it stretches to a length of 5 meters.

    <li data-answer = '196 J' >
        Determine the elastic potential energy contained in the spring.
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '-490 J'>
        Determine the gravitational potential energy in the mass-earth-spring system.
        Consider the zero-height to be the top of the ceiling to which the spring is attached.
        In this case, the gravitational potential energy will be negative,
        but that is okay.
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '-294 J'>
        What is the total energy of the mass-spring-earth system?
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '6 m'>
        Somebody pulls the string down by and additional 1 meter and holds the mass stationary.
        What is the new length of the spring?
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '441 J'>
        Calculate the new elastic potential energy of
        the mass-spring-earth system.
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '-588 J'>
        Calculate the new gravitational potential energy of the mass-spring-earth system.
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '-147 J'>
        Calculate the new total energy of the mass-spring earth system.
    </li>
    <li data-answer = '147 J; positive work'>
        When the person pulled downward on the spring, how much work did they do on the system?
        Did they do positive work (add energy) or negative work (take energy away)?
    </li>
    <li>
        The person lets go of the spring and it begins oscillating upwards and downwards.
        Assume that no work is done on the system as it oscillates.
        Fill out the table below, describing one full oscillation of the mass:
        Note that values will not necessarily reflect realistic values,
        as they were chosen to make the math simpler.
        <div id = 'energyTable1'></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Of the points you selected, at what point is the mass moving fastest?
    </li>
    <li>
        At what points is the mass not moving?
    </li>
    <li>
        When is the spring neither stretched nor compressed?
    </li>
</ol>
