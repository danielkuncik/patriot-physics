<h4>
    Trigonometry in Energy Problems
</h4>

<p>
    Many problems regarding energy, in particular those involving gravitational potential energy,
    involve some geometry and trigonometry.
    This is because the formula for gravitational potential energy involves
    <emph>vertical</emph> height,
    and yet things that move upward often do so at an angle.
    Some basic trigonometry is necessary to find the vertical height.

<p>
    In the problems above, you found a numerical answer for work done on a system.
    In these problems, you will find algebraic equations for work done on a system.
    The formulas you derive will be long and include many terms and variables.
    You do not need to manipulate or solve them,
    but you do need to understand what each of the individual variables means physically.

<p>
    #5 was a trick question!
    <br>
    It was asking for work on the 'ball' not the 'ball-earth system,'
    and therefore gravitational potential energy is not included in the system.
    The block initially had zero energy and later had 32.4 J of kinetic energy.
    <br>
    Gravity did the bulk of work on the block but air resistance
    also did some negative work, causing the block
    to strike the ground with less speed that you would predict
    with the conservation of energy alone.
