<h5>
    Some notes on these problems.
</h5>
<p>
    These are very long problems because I want you to learn how to fully
    and completely analyze a situation using the principles of energy.
    Along with dynamics and kinematics,
    energy is one of the key concepts physicists use to analyze the mechanical world.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the problems I included some notes about proper explanation and proper notation.
    Please seek to always use and understand proper notation.
    One key principle introduced is that a variable alone is considered a variable but a variable
    with a subscript is a specific value of that variable.
</p>

<p>
    Whenever using the conservation of energy, you are typcially makign up new equations.
    It is important to <emph>always explicitly</emph> cite the physical principle used to invent the equation.
    If you use the conservation of energy to derive new equations,
    then always state "This equation is true because no work is done on the system and the total energy of the
    system remains constant."
</p>

<p>
    In this page, you will derive several new functions.
    Whenever deriving a new function, the first thing you should do is check that it is dimensionally correct.
    The second thing you should do is to test your function on known and/or obvious values
    to make sure it returns the values you expect.
    These checks are a part of this activity.

<h3>
    Problem 1: Falling Object
</h3>
<p>
    A person drops an object move mass \( m \) from a cliff of height \( y_0 \) as depicted below.
    Consider the height = 0 point to be the ground.
</p>
<img src = '/podAssets/mechanics/conservation_of_energy_quantitative/vertical_dropped.jpg' height = '300px' width = 'auto'/>
<ol>
    <li>
        Use the conservation of energy to write a symbolic formula for the <strong>Total Energy</strong>
        of the object-earth system in terms of the variables stated here:
        <ol type = 'A'>
            <li>
                Immediately after the mass is dropped,
                when its height is \( y_0 \) and it has no speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the mass is halfway down its fall.
                Its height is half the original height and its speed is
                defined as
                \( v_{\text{half}} \).
            </li>
            <li>
                Immediately before the mass strikes the ground.
                At this point, the height is 0 and its speed is \( v_{\text{max}} \).
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        All of the values for total energy of the object-earth system determined above are equal
        because no work is done on the system.
        When inventing a new formula, it is absolutely crucial that you <emph>explicitly</emph> cite
        the laws of science that make this formula valid.
        To this end, please write a new equation that sets
        all the values above equal and copy the statement "Because no work is done on the object-earth system"
        next to your fomula.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the equality determined above to identify new formulas for key quantities in this situation:
        <ol type = 'A'>
            <li>
                Derive a formula for \( v_{\text{max}} \) in terms of \( y_0 \) and \( g \), the free-fall acceleration on the planet.
                Prove that your formula is dimensionally correct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Derive a formula for \( v_{\text{half}} \) in terms of \( y_0 \) and \( g \).
                Prove that your formula is dimensionally correct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Derive a relationship between \( v_{\text{max}} and \v{\text{half}} \).
                Is the relationship you derived intuitive?
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now, consider some random, undetermined point R in the path of the ball's fall.
        At point r, the height of the ball is given by \( y \) and the speed by \( v \).
        In problems above, subscripts were used to indicate specific values of \( y \) and \( v \),
        but here no subscripts are used to indicate that \( y \) and \( v \) are variables.
        Write an expression for the total energy of the object-earth system at point R.
    </li>
    <img src = '/podAssets/mechanics/conservation_of_energy_quantitative/vertical_dropped_r.jpg' height = '300px' width = 'auto'/>
    <li>
        Using the expression above, derive a formula for \( v \) in terms of \( y \), \( y_0 \), and \( g \).
        Write your equation as $$ v(y) = ... $$
        This notation indicates that you are solving for the speed \( v \) as a function of the vertical position \( y \)
        and that \( y_0 \) and \( g \) are constant values within this function.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prove that the function you determined for \( v(y) \) is dimensionally correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        To test your function, plug in key values of \( y \) and see if you get the values you should.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Find \( v \left( y = y_0 \right) \). Your function should return a value of 0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find \( v \left( y = y_0 / 2 \right) \). Your function should return the value of \( v_{\text{half}} \) determiend above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find \( v \left( y = 0 \right) \). Your function should return the value of \( v_{\text{max}} \) determined above.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
