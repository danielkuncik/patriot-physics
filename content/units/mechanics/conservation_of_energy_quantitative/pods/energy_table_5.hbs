<p>
    In previous problems,
    we considered only kinetic, gravitational potential,
    and elastic potential energy.
    Now we will incorporate <strong>thermal energy</strong>
    into our analysis.
    In the real world, friction and air resistance
    will convert kinetic energy into thermal energy.
    We don't have a formula for thermal energy,
    but we can deduce how much we have by looking at the situation.
</p>

<p>
    Friction and air resistance turn kinetic energy into thermal energy.
    Because, after it is turned into thermal energy, we can
    no longer use this energy for anything, it is sometimes called <strong>heat loss</strong>.
</p>

<h5>
    Rules:
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Conservation of Energy: The total energy of the universe remains the same. It only changes form.
    </li>
    <li>
        \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)
    </li>
    <li>
        \( GPE = mgh \)
    </li>
    <li>
        \( EPE = \frac{1}{2} k \left( x - x_0 \right)^2 \)
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>
    Problem 1:
</h5>
<p>
    A ball with a mass of 4.00 kg is dropped off a short cliff that is 12.0 m tall.
    At the bottom, the ball has a speed of 13.2 m/s.
    Your goal is to determine how much energy is lost to heat?
