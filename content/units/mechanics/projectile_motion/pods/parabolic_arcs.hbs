  This unit deals with projectile motion.
  Projectile motion occurs whenver you throw an object up into the air.
  Examples of projectile motion are shooting a basketball,
  hitting a volleyball,
  firing an arrow,
  or jumping off of a diving broad.
</p>

<p>
  The most important single fact about projectile motion is this:
  All 2-dimensional projecitle motion
  takes the shape of a <strong>parabola</strong>.
  (The only exceptions are if an object is dropped down or thrown directly upward.
  These exceptions are 1-dimensional projectile motion.)

<h4>
  What is a parabola
</h4>

<p>
  A parabola is a shape made by the mathematical equation
  $$
  y = a x^2 + bx + c
  $$
</p>

<h4>
  Examples where parabolic motion is obvious:
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A basketball shot</li>
  <li>A deep touchdown pass</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Examples where parabolic motion is less obvious
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>An olympic archer's shot</li>
  <li>A 5-yard slant</li>
  <li>Spiking a volleyball</li>
  <li>Motion with lots of rotation, like throwing a wrenchin the air</li>
  <li>Human motion, such as a long jump or high jump</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Imporant Implications of parabolic motion
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To strike a target, don't point direclty at it. Point above it.</li>
</ul>
