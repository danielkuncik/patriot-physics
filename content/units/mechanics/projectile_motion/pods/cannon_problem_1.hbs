  This pod will deal with cannons that fire a shot
  that lands on exactly the same level.
  The problems bring together the concepts of the pop-up and horizontal
  launch problems,
  and they are among the most classic physics problems!

<h4>
  Basic cannon Problem
</h4>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
  <li class = 'question'>
    A cannon is aimed at an angle of 30 degrees.
    It fires a cannonball with a speed of 20 m/s.
    The cannonball rises and falls and then
    lands at precisely the vertical level it was fired at.
    <ol class = 'subQuestionList' type = 'a'>
      <li class = 'subQuestion' data-answer = '\( v_{xi} = 17.32 \text{ m/s} \);  \( v_{yi} = 10 \text{ m/s} \)'>
        First, break the initial velocity
        of the cannonball into horizontal and
        vertical components using
        <a href = '/pod/mechanics/two_dimensional_dynamics/vector_form_conversion'>this method</a>.
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion'>
        Similarly to a <a href = '/pod/mechanics/projectile_motion/horizontal_launch_1'>horizontal launch problem</a>,
        we will break the motion into two components.
        In the horizontal dimension, the object moves at a constant speed forward.
        In the vertical dimension, the object is initially moving upward
        and then falls downward to the same point, similarly to a
        <a href = '/pod/mechanics/projectile_motion/pop_up_1'>pop-up problem</a>.
        Fill out the table below, which describes the quantities involved in this problem:
        <div class = 'cannonLaunchTable'></div>
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion' data-answer = '2.04 s'>
        Determine the total time that the cannonball is in the air.
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion' data-answer = '35.35 m'>
        Determine the range of the cannonball, that is, the horizontal displacement
        of the cannonball before it strikes the ground.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
