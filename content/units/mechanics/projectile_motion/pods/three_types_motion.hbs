    An earlier unit dealt extensively with quantitative kinematics,
    and in particular the four kinematic equations.
    This next unit will extend this content to one of the most
    important concepts in physics, projectile motion.
    In order to properly understand projectile motion,
    we first need to learn to categorize motion into three types
    and solve each type of motion appropriately.

<h5>
    Three types of problems about motion
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        If an object is moving with a <strong>constant velocity</strong>,
        the only formula necessary to use is the constant velocity motion formula:
        <ul>
            <li>
                \( \Delta x = v \cdot \Delta t \)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If an object's velocity is changing, but it is moving at a <strong>constant acceleration</strong>,
        This is often called <strong>uniformly accelerated motion</strong>.
        you can use the four kinematic equations to analyze its motion:
        <ul>
            <li>
                \( v_f = v_i + a \cdot \Delta t \)
            </li>
            <li>
                \( \Delta x = v_i \cdot \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a \left( \Delta t \right)^2 \)
            </li>
            <li>
                \( \Delta x = \left( \frac{v_i + v_f}{2} \right) \Delta t \)
            </li>
            <li>
                \( v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \cdot \Delta x \)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the object is moving with a <strong>changing acceleration</strong>,
        then to analyze the motion of the object you must use differential and integral calculus.
    </li>
</ul>

Write a series of problems in which
students need to first identify which type of
motion an object is in and why,
and if it is the first two, they need to solve the problem
-->

<p>
    In a particular physics  [make up problem here]
    a person identifies the motion as "constant."
    Unforutnately, this does not correctly identify the problem
    and what method could be used to solve it. Explain why.
</p>




<p class = 'directions'>
  For each of the following problems, decide which of the three
  types of motion this is.
  You do not need to answer a question if it is asked,
  only categorize the motion.
</p>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'A'>
    A car is driving down the highway at a constant
    speed of 55 mph. How far does it drive in 30 minutes?
    <div class = 'motionMultipleChoice'></div>
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'B'>
    An object is falling down on planet earth.
    Air resistance is ignored.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'C'>
    A car is moving at a constant acceleration of 3 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class = 'directions'>
  For the following table, match a particular type of problem
  with the method necessary to solve that problem.
</p>
<div id = 'matchingTable1'></table>

<p class = 'directions'>
  For each of the following problems,
  decide which of the three available methods you would use
  to solve that particular problem.
</p>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
  <li class ='question' data-answer = 'A'>
    A car is driving down a highway at a constant
    speed of 70 mph. How far does it travel in 5 hours?
    <div class = 'optionsMultipleChoice'></div>
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'B'>
    If a car is capable of stopping with a constant
    acceleration of 5 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
    how much distance does it take it to stop
    if it is moving at 20 m/s?
  </li>
</ol>

<!---
Add a Dynamics section of this!
In which, based on dynamic information, students pick from the same options
-->
<p class = 'directions'>
  Based on the following dynamic information about the objects,
  determine which method you would use to analyze its motion.
</p>
<ul class = 'questionList'>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'A'>
    An object is moving with a net force of zero acting on it.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'B'>
    An object is moving with a non-zero net force acting on it,
    but none of the forces acting on the object are changing.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'C'>
    An object is moving and the forces acting on that object
    change as the object moves.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'C'>
    Analyzing the motion of a mass on a spring.
    The force that the spring pulls changes when the spring changes length.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'B'>
    Analyzing an object falling when the force of gravity
    acting on that object is constant.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'C'>
    An object is falling from such a high distance
    that the force of gravity acting on the object changes as the object falls.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'A'>
    An object is sliding forward.
    with no force pushing it on a frictionless surface.
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'B'>
    An object is sliding forward
    while a constant force of friction opposes its motion.
  </li>
</ul>
