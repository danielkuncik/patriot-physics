{{>kinematicEquationsWithNames}}


<p>
    Like previous sections, this section is based on answering questions using the
    four kinematic equations.
    However, in previous sections, information was very clearly and directly stated.
    In this section, problems are presented as real world questions.
    The most difficult part of these is not the algebra, but in figuring out the information
    you are looking for and in the information your know.
