    The total change in energy of a system
    is equal to the work done on that system.

        A spring has a spring constant of 500 N / m.
        A 250 gram mass is currently stationary at the equilibrium position of the spring.
        Somebody does 20 Joules of work on the mass-spring system,
        and the spring displaces by 20 centimeters.
        Determine the:
