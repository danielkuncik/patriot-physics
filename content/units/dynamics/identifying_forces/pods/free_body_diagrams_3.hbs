<p class = 'introduction'>
  In this pod, you will learn to draw
  free-body diagrams for multiple objects at once.
  In this way, you will connect action-reaction force paris
  and better understand Newton's Third Law.

<h4>
  Idetnifying the Agent and Object of a Force
</h4>

<p class = 'definition' data-word = 'Agent of a Force'>
  Every force must have an <strong>agent</strong>.
  The agent is the thing causing the force.
  The agent <em>must</em> be something physical and real, something you can touch.
  <br>
  It is a good pratice to always identify the agent of a force.
</p>
<p class = 'definition' data-word = 'Object of a Force'>
  Every force must have an <strong>object</strong>.
  The object is the thing receiving the force.
  The object <em>must</em> be something physical and real, something you can touch.
  <br>
  It is a good pratice to always identify the object of a force.
  On a free-body daigram, all forces have the same object.
</p>


<h5>
  Examples
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mike punches Evander in the face.
    The agent of the force is Mike's fist,
    and the object is Evander's face.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gravity is pulling down on a baseball.
    The agent of the force is the earth,
    and the object of the force is the baseball.
  </li>
  <li>
    Joey is lying in bed.
    The normal force is holding him up.
    The agent of this force is the bed,
    and the object of the force is Joey.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Newton's Third Law
</h4>

<p class = 'definition' data-word = "Newton's Third Law">
  If A exerts a force on B,
  then B exerts a force on A with equal magnitude and opposite direciton.
  <br>
  These two forces are called an <strong>action-reaction pair</strong>.
  <br>
  In every pair, the object of one force is the agent of the other force,
  and vice versa!
</p>

<h5>
  Examples
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mike punches Evander in the face.
    This produces a pair of forces:
    <ol type = 'A'>
      <li>The agent of force A is Mike's fist and the object is Evander's face.</li>
      <li>The agent of force B is Evander's face and the object is Mike's face.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Gravity is pulling down on a baseball.
  </li>
  <li>
    Joey is lying in bed.
  </li>
</ul>


<p class = 'directions'>
  Each statement describes a force.
  Describe the agent and the object of <em>both</em> forces on a pair.

<h5>
  How to idetify action-reaction pairs on free-body diagrams
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Action-reaction pairs <em>always</em>
    appear on different free-body diagrams.
  </li>
  <li>
    Imagine that Mike punches Evander:
    <ul>
      <li>There is a force on Evander's free-body diagram whose agent is Mike</li>
      <li>There is a force on Mike's free-body diagram whose agent is Evander</li>
    </ul>
    These forces are an action-reaction pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action-Reaction pairs always have equal magnitude and opposite direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Every</em> force is part of a pair.
    Sometime's you don't see them because you don't draw every free-body
    diagram you can, but they are <em>always</em> there.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Balanced Force Pairs
</h4>

<p>
  In order to master physics, you need to learn to identify
  all action-reaction force pairs.
  Unfortunately for students of physics, in most problems,
  there are <em>other pairs</em> of forces that
  <em>also</em> have equal magnitude and opposite direction,
  but aren't action-reaction force pairs.
  &#x1f615;
  &#x1f615;
  &#x1f615;
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, in this lesson we are going to also identify <em>balanced force pairs</em>.
</p>

<p class = 'definition' data-answer = 'Balanced Force Pairs'>
  A balanced force pair are a pair of forces
  with equal magnitude and opposite direction that
  act on the <em>same object</em>.
  <br>
  They usually consist of one force with definite magnitude
  and another force with adjustable magnitude called a <em>constraint force</em>.
</p>

<h5>
  How to Identify Balanced Force Pairs
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Balanced force pairs appear on the <em>same</em> free-body diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    Balanced forces occur when an object has net force zero in
    either the X or Y dimension.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usually, one of the two balanced forces is a <em>constraint force</em>.
    A constraint force is a force that does not have a particular magnitude
    but adjusts its magnitude to match a particular situation.
    The most common constraint forces are normal force, tension (sometimes), and static friction.
  </li>
</ul>
