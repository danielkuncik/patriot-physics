  In two previous pods, we learned to find the net force
  acting on an object and to use the formula Newton's Second Law
  which relates net force, mass and acceleration.
  In this pod, we will put them together.
  Our goal is to find the acceleration of an object if we know
  only the forces acting on that object.

    An object has a mass of 20 kg and has two forces acting on it:
    <div id = 'object1'></div>
    <script>$("#object1").append(fastFBD([['left',100],['right',60]]).drawCanvas(200));</script>
    <ol class = 'subQuestionList' type = 'a'>
      <li class = 'subQuestion' data-answer = '40 N LEFT'>
        Determine the magnitude and direction of the net force
        acting on this object.
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion' data-answer = '2 m/s/s'>
        Using Newton's Second Law, determine the magnitude of acceleration
        of this object.

    An object has a mass of 6 kg and has three forces acting on it:

        Using Newton's Second Law, determine the magnitude of acceleration
