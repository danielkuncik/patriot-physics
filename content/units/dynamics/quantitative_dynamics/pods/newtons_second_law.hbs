    The ultimate goal of dynamics is to explain <emph>why</emph>
    objects move by understanding the forces acting on those objects.
    One crucial formula allows us to accomplish this.
    This formula relates the <emph>forces</emph>
    acting on an object to the <emph>acceleration</emph>
    of that object:
    Newton's Second Law.
