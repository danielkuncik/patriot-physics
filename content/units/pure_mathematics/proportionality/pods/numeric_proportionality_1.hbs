  Direct Proportion
</h4>

<ul class = 'definition' data-word = 'Direct Proportion'>
  <li>
    When two quantities are <strong>directly proportional</strong>,
    whenever you multiply one quantity,
    you multiply the other by the same factor.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you divide one quantity, you divide the other by the same divisor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Two quantities in direct proportion can be represented by the equation:
    $$
    \frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{B_2}{B_1}
    $$
  </li>
</ul>
