    An electromagnetic wave is a type of wave consisting of oscillating
    <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'electric'>_______________</li> and <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'electric'>_______________</li> energy.
    Electromagnetic waves always come in tiny little pieces called <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'photon'>_______________</li>,
    and all electromagnetic waves move at a speed of <li class = 'question' data-answer = '\( 3.0 \cdot 10^8 \text{m/s} \)'>_______________</li>.
    Electromagnetic waves are different from another type of wave, called a mechanical wave.
    Electromagnetic waves are capable of moving through a <li class ='question' data-answer = 'vacuum'>_______________</li>,
    while mechanical waves are not.
    Electromagnetic waves are all <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'transverse'>_______________</li> waves,
    while mechanical waves can be either transverse or longitudinal waves.
    Electromagnetic waves all move much much <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'faster'>_______________</li> than mechanical waves.
    There are seven different types of electromagnetic wave.
    One of these types is <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'visible'>_______________</li> light,
    while the other six are all <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'invisible'>_______________</li>.

    <li class = 'question' data-answer ='The light waves that the sun creates are electromagnetic and can move through the
vacuum of space. The sound waves that the sun creates are mechanical and cannot move
through a vacuum.'>
        You can see the sun but you cannot hear the sun. And the sun is making lots and lots of noise, as much as thousands of atomic bombs exploding every second. Explain why you can see the sun but not hear it.
    </li>
    <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'When electrons jump to earth, they create light and sound. The light waves are
electromagnetic and the sound waves are mechanical. The sound waves move fast, but the light waves move much much much faster. Therefore, you see the lightning almost instantaneously, but you hear the thunder seconds after.'>
        By using the concepts and vocabulary on this page, explain why you see lightning before you hear thunder.
