Doppler Effect Ideas (from Barry Parnas)

[to add to the 'Doppler Diagrams' pod]


Imagine someone is rolling a marble at you every second,
You are standing on the other side of the room.
The marbles move at 1 m/s.

[assume no every loss etc.]

How many marbles do you get every second?


Now, imagine that you are walking TOWARDS the person
who is rolling the marbles at a speed of 0.5 m/s.
How many marbles do you get every second?

Now, imagine that you are walking AWAY FROM the person
who is rolling the marbles at a speed of 0.5 m/s.
How many marbles do you get every second?

[Then imagine that the person is walking at 0.5 m/s,
or the person is walking at 0.5 m/s away]
