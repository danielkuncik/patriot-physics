<h4>
    The word "Radiation"
</h4>

<p>
    When people see the word “radiation” they often think of something very dangerous.
    But, in physics, “radiation” is not dangerous at all.
    In fact, you are surrounded by completely safe radiation all the time!
</p>

<p class="definition">
    In physics <strong>"radiation"</strong> is
    a synonym for <strong>electromagnetic wave</strong>.
    It can mean any wave:
    radio, micro, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-Ray, or gamma ray.
    It is also often called <strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The word "radiation" comes from the same root as the word "radius",
    as in the radius of a circle.
    If you have some source of electromagnetic waves,
    such as a light bulb, it sends electromagnetic waves out in every single direction,
    just like the radii come out in every direction from the center of a circle or sphere.

<h4>
    Ionizing Radiation vs. Non-Ionizing Radiation
</h4>

<p class="definition">
    All electromagnetic radiation comes in tiny pieces
    called <strong>photons</strong>.
    Each photon has a very specific amount of energy.
    For example, a photon of red light has 1.8 electron Volts of energy.
</p>

<p class="definition">
    An <strong>ion</strong> is an atom that does not have
    a neutral change. It is called an ion because it has
    either gained or lost an electron.
</p>

<p>
    Imagine that a photon of light strieks an atom.
    If the photon has enough energy, then it will knock
    one of the electrons in the atom out of the atom.
    We say that the photon <emph>ionized</emph>
    the atom.
</p>


<p>
    The simplest atom is hydrogen and has only one proton and one electron.
    It takes 13.6 electron volts of energy to knock the electron out of the hydrogen atom.
    Thus, all electromagnetic photons with an energy greater than 13.6 electron Volts are called <strong>ionizing radiation</strong>.
    All electromagnetic waves with an energy less than 13.6 electron Volts are called <strong>non-ionizing radiation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    A photon with precisely 13.6 electron volts, the first photon that is considered <emph>ionizing</emph>,
    comes in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<p>
    In physics, as stated above, the word “radiation” does not mean something dangerous, but rather means any electromagnetic wave.
    There is both non-dangerous radiation and dangerous radiation.
    The dangerous radiation is the ionizing radiation and the non-dangerous radiation is the non-ionizing radiation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Cancer</strong> and other diseases can be caused
    by exposure to ionizing radiation.
</p>

<h5>
    What are the main sources of ionizing radiation?
</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        The sun (high energy ultraviolet light)
    </li>
    <li>
        Radon (a gas that seeps out of the ground into
        people’s basements and emits high energy
        radiation)

<ol class="questionList">
    <li class="question" data-answer = 'C.'>
        You may have a broken bone!
        Your doctor recommends an X-Ray to see if you have a broken bone.
        Which of the following is most true:
        <ol type = 'A'>
            <li>
                There is no risk of an X-Ray camera because it emits
                non-izoning radiation.
            </li>
            <li>
                The X-Ray camera emits extremely dangerous ionizing radiation.
            </li>
            <li>
                The X-Ray camera does emit ionizing radiation,
                but ionizing radiation,
                but the heath risk of a single pulse of ionizing radiation
                is much much less than the health risk of an undiagnosed broken bone.
                It is appropriate to receive an X-Ray when your doctor recommends it, but not frivolously.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>
    Gamma Rays: Very Dangerous:
</h4>

<p>
    The three types of ionizing radiation are high energy ultraviolet rays, X-Rays,
    and gamma rays. However, gamma rays photons, because they have the highest
    energy of any photon, are much more dangerous.
    The risk is not that they will simply knock electrons out of atoms
    and disrupt your cells, but that they will completely eradicate human cells entirely!
    They have enough energy to break apart the chemical bonds that hold your molecules together.
    If there were ever a massive amount of gamma rays (such as in a gamma ray burst),
    it would be like the guns fired by aliens in a sci-fi movie, and simply vaporize everything in their path.
</p>

<h4>
    Are microwave ovens dangerous:
</h4>

<p>
    Many people believe that a microwave oven sends
    out “dangerous radiation” into the kitchen, or even into your food.
    A microwave oven works because microwaves
    have precisely the correct amount of energy to
    vibrate water molecules very fast.
    Because nearly all food involves water,
    microwaves give a much more efficient way to heat
    food than the more traditional method of using infrared
    waves (heat from your oven).
    But are the microwaves made by the oven dangerous?
    Well, they are certainly non-ionizing radiation,
    and have even less energy than visible light! So, no.
    If you search online, you will find plenty of
    weird side effects of heating with a microwave you can read about.
    You will need to decide about that for yourself.
    But, the important thing to know for physics class is this:
    microwave ovens produce non-ionization radiation,
    so there is no reason to assume they’d be dangerous.

        Microwaves are ionizing radiation.
    </li>

        Standing next to a microwave oven when heating up a pizza means that very dangerous radiation is moving through your body.
    </li>

</ol>

<h4>
    Are Cell Phones Dangerous:
</h4>

<p>
    Cell Phones use microwaves to communicate.
    Therefore, everything just stated about microwave ovens
    is also true about cell phones:
    Cell phones emit non-ionizing radiation unlikely to cause any damage.
    However, there is one potential cause for concern:
    Microwaves, though they do not damage DNA or cells, do heat up water very effectively, and
    your body is made primarily of water.
    Thus, a cell phone held near any part of your body (particularly your brain)
    for a long period of time can cause that body part to increase slightly in temperature.
    This could have potentially cause negative health effects.
    Scientists are continuing to study this risk.
    There is still disagreement. Clearly, the risk is not enormous, otherwise it would be obvious.
    You can make your own determination about the potential risk of cellphones,
    but for physics class, it is crucial to understand that
    any potential risk of cell phones comes from heating of water in your
    body and NOT from high energy electromagnetic radiation.

<h4>
    Radiation and COVID-19
</h4>

<p>
    There is a potential that ultraviolet radiation could damage COVID-19 cells.
    Ultraviolet radiation IS ionizing radiation, and has the potential
    to damage the DNA the coronavirus and stop it from spreading.
    However, scientists have not totally confirmed this fact,
    and because ultraviolet radiation has other negative healt effects on the body,
    this is probably not the best way to attempt to combat the virus.

<a href = 'https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/'>Article on this</a>


<p>
    Some articles online have been suggesting putting your mail in the microwave
    in order to kill potential coronavirus on your mail.
    First of all, it isn’t very likely there is coronavirus on your mail,
    but separate from that, let’s evaluate the physics of this idea:
</p>
<p>
    a) Can microwaves kill cells?
    NO! Microwaves are non-ionizing radiation. For they same reason they are not dangerous to you, they are not dangerous to coronavirus cells.
</p>
<p>
    b) What do microwaves do? They HEAT UP THINGS.
</p>
<p>
    c) Can heating up your mail kill coronavirus on your mail?
    Potentially, yes it could. But you know what else heating up your mail will do?
    START A FIRE!!!
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, don't put your mail in the microwave.
