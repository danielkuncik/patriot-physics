<h4>
  Using a force meter:
</h4>


<p>
  This is a lab intended to introduce
  quantitative dynamics.
  The key concept in dynamics is the <strong>force</strong>.
  The forces acting on an object determine
  its acceleration and thus its motion.
</p>

<p>
  Force is measured quantitatively with a force-meter.
  A force meter is simply a spring with a calibrated
  ruler that gives the force acting on an object in Newtons.
</p>

<p>
  Some forces, in addition to having a scale of Newtons,
  have another scale of grams.
  This, however, is very bad, and you should never use this scale!
  In my classes, I typically cover it up with duct tape.
  That is because grams are a measure of mass, not force.
  A force meter should be used only to measure force
  and never mass!
</p>


<p>
  Every force meter has a particular maximum force.
  If you pull harder than the maximum force,
  then the force meter simply locks at the maximum (or "maxes out"),
  and it is impossible to get a reading.
  However, if you pull much weaker than the maximum force,
  then you will get in inaccurate reading.
  It is important to use the correct force meter for each task!
</p>


<p class = 'directions'>
  For each of the following list of tasks,
  use a force-meter to determine the magnitude of force
  necessary to complete the task.
  Some might require you to build a tiny contraption
  with duct tape to attach the force meter hook
  to something.
