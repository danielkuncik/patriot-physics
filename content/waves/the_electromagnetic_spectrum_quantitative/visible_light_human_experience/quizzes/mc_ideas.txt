Assume that there is a finite amount of light in the universe.
How much of this light is visible to the human eye?
A. all of it
B. not all, but more than half
C. about half of it
D. about 20 % of it
E. an extremely tiny portion

Of all the light given off by the sun, how much is visible to humans?



Why is visible light visible?
A. eyes evolved to be sensitive to the light given off in the greatest intensity by the sun
B. eyes evolved to be sensitive to the light int he middle of the spectrum



In all physics textbooks, visible light appears in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum. Is this accurate?
A. no, the actual middle is X-Rays
B. the electromagnetic spectrum extends infinitely in all directions and has no middle

Physicists categorize electromagnetic waves into 7 categories.


Let's assume the barrier between infrared and microwaves is a wavelength of 1 millimeter.
Consider two waves, wave A has a wavelength of 1.01 millimeters and wave B has a wavelength of 0.999 millimeters.
What is the difference between these waves?

A. wave A can heat water in a microwave oven, wave B is perceptible with an infrared camera
B. wave A is able to make a cell phone work, while wave B is able to make a remote control work.
C. wave A is present in the cosmic microwave background, wave B is given off by star forming regions.
D. A, B, and C
E. The physical difference between these waves is negligible.
