B. They detect the motion of molecules, which is faster for warmer objects.
C. They are an array of tiny thermometers that measure temperature in each direction.
D.

B. No, they all have similar temperature and give off similar amounts of infrared light.

Infrared cameras are frequently used to improve home energy efficiency by:
A. detecting areas where there is a potentially poor heat insulation
B.



Infrared cameras are frequently used by law enforcement because:
A. humans are still warmer than their environment, even if there is little visible light around
B.
