Significant figures concepts
(and/or math vs. physics)

A studnet is givne the following problem:
"An object moves 10.0 m in a time of 30.0 seconds. Calculate its average velocity."
They do the following calculation:
"aveage velocity is displacement divided by time = 10 / 30 = 1/3"

What is the BEST way for them to report their answer?

A. 1/3  m/s, it is the most accurate
B. .3 (with a line over it) m/s, it is accurate, but uses decimals
C. 0.333  m/s, because it presents only the digits whihc the student can confidently say are accurate.
D. 0.3 m/s, because it is rounded to one decimal place
E. 0.33333333 m/s, it gets the message across best


In math class, most students are told to write answers in the most exact way possible, and to include radicals and transcendental numbesr (pi and e) in their answers:
In physics,

A. in the most exact way possible, because physics is actually a branch of mathematics
B. as decimals, because math represent concepts, whereas physics answers represent measureable quantities



which of the following BEST states the relationship between math and physics:

A. physics is a branch of applied math
B. physics is a branch of science that uses many tools of mathematics



which of the following is a key difference between math and science as modes of human thought?

A. mathematicians can explore any problem they find interesting; scientists must use mathematical tools related to observable quantities.
