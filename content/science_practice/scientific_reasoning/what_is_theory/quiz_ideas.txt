[many of these questions are didactic,
I should probably indicate that in the directions]

What event leads to a theory becomming a more



Which statement best describes the difference between a "theory", and a "law."
- they are all basically the same thing, the only difference is how much data has been collected in support of the idea.
- a theory is something that is not applicable to everyday life, whereas a law is applicable to every day life
- anything called a "theory" has not been accepted by at least 50 % of scientists.
-


The best definition of a "hypothesis" is:
- An educated guess as to how you think an experiment will turn out
- The prediction of a particular theory a scientist is testing
- A theory that is supported by only 20 % of scientists
-


Two students complete a lab report. The data they collect includes multiple outliers, to the point
where they are unable to create a good ebst fit line of their data.
They conclude that the outliers existsed due to faulty measurement, though there is no evidence
that they were off.
[put some actualy data here, with a picture]
[however, the device has very low friction and they were adequately.....]
The teacher gives them a low grade. Was this grade fair?
- No, the students conclusion was adequate.
- Yes, the students should have concluded that the theory was not correct in the context in which they were studying it
- Yes, if the students had been more careful, the measurements would have followed the data.
- Yes, if they students had taken more measurements, they would have observed a pattern.
