The goal of this pod is to know all physics quantities in an organized way

this is an advanced pod

concepts:

1. all quantities can be organized into dimensions
2. there are seven base dimensions, other dimensions are derived from the seven base dimensions
2. all quantities of a single dimension all have the same possible units and the same SI unit
3. there are seven base SI units, each corresponding to a single dimension. the SI unit for each dimension is derived from the base SI units in the same way that the dimension itself is derived from base dimensions.
3. each quantity is either a vector or a scalar, within a single dimension different quantities may be either vectors or scalars
4. vectors can be broken into components, in which each component is a scalar quantitiy of the same dimesion


length
- position
- length
- height (vertical component of position)
- change in position (called displacement)
- change in height
