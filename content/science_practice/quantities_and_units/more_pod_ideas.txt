types of problems on this: [maybe in different pods]
- memorizing SI units of each quantity
- being able to state the principles above
- problems in which people must convert BEFORE using a formula
- problems in which students must convert AFTER using a formula
- problems in which students must convert sometimes before, sometimes after, sometimes before and after, sometimes never...they jsut have to determine on their own
[these conversion + formula problems should span from 2 through 4]



- perhaps a writing focused pod called 'non-si units?' in which students need to show to to solve problems without using SI units?
- maybe a pod called 'identifying mistakes'

[ put these into the conversions] pod



[this should be included in the conversions unit.....]
