I need to make a lesson on quantities and units,
what are quantities,
what are units?

=> this is a co-unit with dimensional analysis!

Some topics that should be considered=

- what are examples of quantities, and what is a quantitiy
- what are examples of units, and what is a unit


This is an uber-theoretical piece! [a unit on units!, very meta
the meta-est problem]

pods:
- what is a quantity
- what is a unit
- SI units and the SI unit system
- the 'great tribe of quantities'
- constructing units from SI units
[should conversions go up top and dimensional analysis come down here?]



What really is a unit?
- a unit comes from the latin word ____ meaning 1
- if you have 1 of your quantity, then this is the amount you will have


Think of this
6 feet = 6 * foot


How do I assess this?



In a physics problem, I typically advise you NOT to write the units when solving an equation
in order to make it simpler.
Why are yuo able to do this and still get a correct answer?
- Units are not a part of an equation, only a completed answer
- Because this is an simper course, in a more advanced course you would need to write the units
- Units are a part of the equation, but if you always use the SI units they always work out correctly without effort.
