I need to make a lesson on quantities and units,
what are quantities,
what are units?

=> this is a co-unit with dimensional analysis!

Some topics that should be considered=

- what are examples of quantities, and what is a quantitiy
- what are examples of units, and what is a unit


This is an uber-theoretical piece! [a unit on units!, very meta
the meta-est problem]

pods:
- what is a quantity
- what is a unit
- SI units and the SI unit system
- the 'great tribe of quantities'
- constructing units from SI units
[should conversions go up top and dimensional analysis come down here?]



What really is a unit?
- a unit comes from the latin word ____ meaning 1
- if you have 1 of your quantity, then this is the amount you will have


Think of this
6 feet = 6 * foot


How do I assess this?
