    Three Formulas
</h3>

<p>
    There are three different formulas we will used for \( Q \), heat energy added to an substance.

        <ul>
            <li>You have 0.300 kg of copper at a temperature of 24.0 degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>You want to completely melt this copper. To do so, you must first heat it to the melting point of copper, and then melt it.</li>
            <li>The melting point of copper is 1085 degrees Celsius.</li>
        </ul>

                Draw a semi-qualitative graph with temperature on the vertical axis and heat energy added on the horizontal axis.
                Use this graph to show how the copper progresses first from solid copper at 24.0 degrees Celsius to liquid copper at 1085 degrees Celsius.
                Label two portions of the graph. One portion is "increase in temperature" and the other is "melting."
                For the purposes of exposition, I'm putting the answer here, but please spend time on analyzing it to understand why it is the answer:

            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = '\( Q_1 =  225993 \text{ J} \)'>
                Solve for the heat energy added in the first portion section in which the copper is heated. This variable can be called \( Q_1 \).
                Because this is an increase in temperature,
                it will use the formula \( Q_1 = m C \Delta T \).
                (Please do not round your answer).
            </li>
            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = '\( Q_2 = 61500 \text{ J} \)'>
                Solve for the heat energy added in the second portion of the graph in which the copper is melted. This variable can be called \( Q_2 \).
                Because this is a phase transition between a solid and liquid, we use the heat of fusion formula:
                \( Q_2 = m H_f \).
                (Please do not round your answer.)
            </li>
            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = '\( Q_T = 287493 \text{ J} \)'>
                Add the heat added in each section to find the total heat energy added to the copper, which we can call Q_T, or Q-total:
                $$
                Q_T = Q_1 + Q_2.
                $$
                (Please do not round your answer.)

            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = '\( Q_T = 2.87 \cdot 10^5 \text{ J} \)'>
