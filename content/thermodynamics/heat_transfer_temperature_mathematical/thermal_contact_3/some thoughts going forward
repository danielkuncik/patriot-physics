1. this should be multiple pods

level 4
the first pod should focus on the math and solving gofr T_f

the second pod should focus on the concepts behind the math

the third pod should be a lab-based pod on determining the specific heat of a metal using this method
(the quiz for this should be a series a photos, and use them to determine the specific heat, and calculate a percent error)

level 5
the fourth pod, a big challenge, should be mixtures including change of phase
