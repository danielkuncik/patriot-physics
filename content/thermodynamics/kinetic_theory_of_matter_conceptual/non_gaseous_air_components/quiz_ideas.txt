Your friend wants to take liquid nitrogen home in a plastic water bottle. He says that if he pours it into the bottle and seals
the the top, it'll stop boiling and he can take it home.
What should you tell him?
["reorder": false]
- You are correct, that will work perfectly.
- Not only will it work, it will be like an ice pack you can use to soothe an injury, but more effective.
- Unfortunately, I don't think the liquid nitrogen will hold, but there's no harm in tryning!
- Great idea...if you want to lose an eye.


What happens if you put an open bowl of liquid nitrogen in your freezer?
- it freezes into solid nitrogen
- it stays the same as liquid nitrogen
- it still boils away, just a little more slowly than outside the freezer
