A car drives horizontally at a speed of 23.5 m/s off of a cliff
that is 18.2 m tall.
How far will the car land from the edge of the cliff?

A super slow car drives horizontally at a speed of 0.155 m/s off of a very scary cliff
that is 230. m tall.
How far will the car land from the edge of the cliff?

A car drives horizontally at a speed of 20.3 m/s off a cliff
and lands a distance 95.8 m from the side of the cliff.
How tall was the cliff?

A car drives off a cliff that was 34.8 meters tall
and falls a distance of 87.8 m from the edge.
How fast was it moving when it drove off the cliff?

A car drives off a cliff that is 30.0 m tall with a speed of 15.0 m/s.
