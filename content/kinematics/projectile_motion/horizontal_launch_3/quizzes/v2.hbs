        A car is driven horizontally off a cliff of height \( h \) and lands a distance \( \Delta x \) from the cliff.
        In terms of \( h \), \( \Delta x \), and known constants, determine an equation for the speed (magnitude of velocity) at which the car strikes the ground.
        Note that the magnitude if velocity is determined by finding each component of velocity and using the Pythagorean Theorem.
