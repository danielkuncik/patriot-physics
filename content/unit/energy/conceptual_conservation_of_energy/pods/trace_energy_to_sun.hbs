    In the pods of this topic, our goal has been to identify types of energy
    and to describe how energy changes from one type to another.
    In this pod, our goal is to trace all energy transfers back to their initial source: the sun.
    Of the energy on earth, the vast majority originated with light from the sun.
    All the energy in your life: the kinetic energy of you walking around,
    the light energy from a bulb,
    or the potential energy in your phone's battery, can be traced back, step by step, to the sun.

                            Once upon a time, there was a very hot ball of gas called the sun.
                            The sun gave of electromagnetic waves in all directions,
                            which then traveled through the infinite void of space.

                            But, a very small fraction of these electromagnetic waves,
                            after travelling 93 million miles, landed on a large rock.

                            Most of the waves just heated up the earth.
                            But some of them struck a field full of wheat.
                            When the electromagnetic waves struck the wheat,
                            it triggered a chemical reaction inside of the wheat plants.
                            The chemical reaction took carbon dioxide from the air,
                            and used it to build the structure of the wheat.
                            This was called photosynthesis.

                            So, when he came to the stairs,

            Most of the electromagnetic waves only heated up the earth.
            But a few of them struck a beautiful green pine tree.
            The light triggered a chemical reaction in the needles of the pine tree,

            The tree lived a long and wonderful life,
            but al things come to an end.
            The tree fell to the ground, and over time,
            the molecules that made up the tree were
            pushed underground.
            For millions of years, the tree-molecules were exposed
            to pressure,
            and they turned into a hard piece of coal inside
            the mountains of that people would someday in the future call West Virginia.

        <div class = 'carousel-item'>
            People began moving into the mountains of West Virginia.
            Soon, they began going into the ground underneath the mountains
            and taking the coal out.
            The coal was put into train cars and sent all over the United
            States.
            The piece of coal that was the tree arrived
            at a power plan in Swansea, Massachusetts.

        <div class = 'carousel-item'>
            A worker threw the coal into a furnace.

            This hot air turned around a massive turbine.

        <div class = 'carousel-item'>
            The spinning turbine was located within a magnetic field,
