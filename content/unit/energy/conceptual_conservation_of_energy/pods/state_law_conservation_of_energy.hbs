    The Law of the Conservation of Energy is arguably the central law
    in every branch of science.
    Not only the theories of physics, but chemistry, biology, astronomy, earth science,
    ecology, and environmental science depend on this crucial law.
    For that reason, you should be able to state the Law of Conservation of Energy
    word for word.
