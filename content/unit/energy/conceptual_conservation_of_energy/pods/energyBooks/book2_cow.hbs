                Once upon a time, there was a very hot ball of gas called the sun.
                The sun gave of electromagnetic waves in all directions,
                which then traveled through the infinite void of space.

                    Most of the waves just heated up the earth.
                    But some of them struck a meadow of beautiful green grass.
                    When the electromagnetic waves struck the grass,
                    it triggered a chemical reaction inside of the blades of grass.
                    The chemical reaction took carbon dioxide from the air,
                    and used it to build the structure of the grass.
                    This was called photosynthesis.

                A cow in the field eats the grass.
                The cows digenstive system breaks down the molecuels
                that form the structure of the grass,
                and are used to build the muscles of the cow.
