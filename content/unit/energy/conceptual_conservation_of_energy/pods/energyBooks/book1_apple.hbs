                Once upon a time, there was a very hot ball of gas called the sun.
                The sun gave of electromagnetic waves in all directions,
                which then traveled through the infinite void of space.

                But, a very small fraction of these electromagnetic waves,
                after travelling 93 million miles, landed on a large rock.
                This large rock was called earth.

                The electromagnetic waves landed all over the earth.
                Some of them landed on the leaves of an apple tree.
                Inside those leaves, the plant cells used the light to turn
                carbon dioxide from the air into sugars molecules of an apple.
                This process was called photosynthesis.

                Most of the waves just heated up the earth.
                But some of them struck a field full of wheat.
                When the electromagnetic waves struck the wheat,
                it triggered a chemical reaction inside of the wheat plants.
                The chemical reaction took carbon dioxide from the air,
                and used it to build the structure of the wheat.
                This was called photosynthesis.

                One day, somebody picked an apple from the tree.
                They later sold it at a market to someone named Daniel.
                When Daniel was hungry, he ate the apple.
                His body digested and stored the sugars inside the apple.

                His room was on the second floor of Old Rochester
                Regional High School.
                So, when he came to the stairs,
                chemical reactions inside his body
                activated his muscles to push his body upwards.
