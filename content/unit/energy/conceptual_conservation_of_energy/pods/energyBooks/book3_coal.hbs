                This book tells the story of how a light bulb
                turned on during the 20th century,
                when coal was the leading source of electrical energy in the United States.

                Once upon a time, there was a very hot ball of gas called the sun.
                The sun gave of electromagnetic waves in all directions,
                which then traveled through the infinite void of space.

                But, a very small fraction of these electromagnetic waves,
                after travelling 93 million miles, landed on a large rock.
                This large rock was called earth.

                Most of the electromagnetic waves only heated up the earth.
                But a few of them struck a beautiful green pine tree.
                The light triggered a chemical reaction in the needles of the pine tree,
                and carbon dioxide turned into the structure of the tree.

                The tree lived a long and wonderful life,
                but al things come to an end.
                The tree fell to the ground, and over time,
                the molecules that made up the tree were
                pushed underground.
                For millions of years, the tree-molecules were exposed
                to pressure,
                and they turned into a hard piece of coal inside
                the mountains of that people would someday in the future call West Virginia.

                People began moving into the mountains of West Virginia.
                Soon, they began going into the ground underneath the mountains
                and taking the coal out.
                The coal was put into train cars and sent all over the United
                States.
                The piece of coal that was the tree arrived
                at a power plan in Swansea, Massachusetts.
