<h3>
    Problem 3: Horizontal Spring
</h3>
<p>
    A spring with spring constant \( k \) and equilibrium length \( x_0 \)
    is attached to a mass of \( m \).
    Somebody pulls the spring back to a length \( x_{\text{max}} \) and lets go.
    Initially, the mass is not moving.
    Assume the spring is frictionless and massless.

<ol>
    <li> (REPEAT!)
        Write expressions representing the total energy of the block-spring system
        at several different points in the motion of the block:
        <ol type = 'A'>
            <li>
                Initially, when it is not moving and the length of the spring is \( x_{\text{max}} \).

                When the block, after having being let go, passes through the equilibrium position
                of the spring. At this point, the speed of the block is \( v_{\text{max}} \)
                and the length of the spring is \( x_0 \).

            <li>
                When the sping is at its maximum compressions.
                At this point, the block is momentarily stationary and the length of the spring is \( x_{\text{min}} \).

                When the block, having reversed direction, passes back through the equilibrium point.

                When the block returns to its the initial position.

    <li> (REPEAT!)
        Set the expressions above equal to create a large equation explaining the motion of the spring-block system.
        Write a sentence explaining why such an equation is valid.
        Eliminate any redundancies in the equation
    </li>
    <li> (REPEAT!)
        Use the equation to derive new formulas for key variables.
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                Derive a formula for \( v_{\text{max}} \) in terms of \( m \), \( k \), \( x_0 \), and \( x_{\text{max}}  \).
                Prove your formula is dimensionally correct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Derive a formula for \( x_{\text{min}} \) in terms of \( x_{\text{max}} \) and \( x_0 \).
                The minimum length should be the same distance from equilibrium as the maximum length.
                Show that your formula reflects this.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now, consider some random point R in the motion of the block.
        At point R, the length of the spring is given by \( x \) and the speed of the block is given by \( v \).
        The variables are written without subscripts, indicating they refer to any value of horizontal position and speed,
        not specific values.

        <img src = '/podAssets/energy/conservation_of_energy_quantitative/horizontal_spring_r.jpg' width = '319px' height = 'auto'/>
        <br>
        Determine an expression for the total energy of the block-spring system at point R.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the expression above to derive a function \( v(x) \)
        for speed in terms of horizontal position that includes constant values
        \( m \), \( k \), \( x_0 \), and \( x_{\text{max}} \).
    </li>
    <li>
        Prove that the function you derived in dimensionally correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate that the function you derived is logical by plugging in the information that you already know.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Show that \( v \left( x = x_{\text{max}} \right) = 0. \)
            </li>
            <li>
                Show that \( v \left( x = x_{\text{min}} \right) = 0. \)
            </li>
            <li>
                Show that \( v \left( x = x_0 \right) = v_{\text{max}} \)

    <li>
        \( \frac{1}{2} k \left( x_{\text{max}} - x_0 \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} k \left( x_{\text{min}} - x_0 \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_{\text{max}}^2 \)
        <br>
        This equation is valid because no work is done on the mass-spring system.
        Thus, according to the Law of Conservation of Energy, the quantities of total energy at each point in time
        must be equal.

            <li>
                \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( x_{\text{max}} - x_0 \right) \)

            <li>
                \( x_{\text{min}} = 2 x_0 - x_{\text{max}} \)

    </li>
    <li>
        \( \text{Energy} = \frac{1}{2} k \left( x - x_0 \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)
    </li>
    <li>
        \( \frac{1}{2} k \left( x - x_0 \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} k \left( x_{\text{max}} - x_0 \right)^2 \)
    </li>
    <li>
        \( v(x) = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} \left[ \left( x_{\text{max}} - x_0 \right)^2 - \left( x - x_0 \right)^2 \right] } \)
        <br>
        I would recommend not trying to turn this function into a simpler form by evaluating the squares.
        It is easier to understand conceptually and see the special cases in this form.
