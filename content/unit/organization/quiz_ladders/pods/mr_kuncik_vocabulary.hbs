- pod
--- the physics curriculum is broken into many, very small units called pods
- every pod consists of two parts: a practice page and an assessment

- ladder
- topic

- score vs grade


- due date vs. 'can retake' date

- physics score vs. grade


Every single pod has a practice page and an assessment!

assessments are one of these forms
quiz (by far the most common)
- you can take a quiz by yourself
- you are required to work alone on a quiz
- you receive a randomized version of each quiz


memorization quizzes
- memoriztion quizzes do not have random versions, they have the same questions every time
- memorization quizzes must be taken in class


problem sets:
- problem sets are more challening work than quizzes (typically on level 4 or level 5)
-


labe report:


lab practical:
- a lab practical is a quiz in which you build or create something

creative work:
- creative work (typically level 6) is freely accessible
- pods with creative work do not ahve practice pages
