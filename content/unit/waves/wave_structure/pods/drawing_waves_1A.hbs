<p class="introduction">
    In this pod, we will first focus on drawing waves
    with a particular wavelength.
</p>

<p class="directions">
    For each of the questions below,
    draw a wave with a particular wavelength.
    Your wave should have at least three crests and troughs.
</p>


<ol class = 'questionList'>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Draw a transverse wave with a wavelength of 3 boxes.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid1'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Draw a transverse wave with a wavelength of 2 boxes.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid2'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Draw a transverse wave with a wavelength of 5 boxes.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid3'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Draw a transverse wave with a wavelength of 9 boxes.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid4'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Draw a transverse wave with a wavelength of 1 box.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid5'></div>
    </li>
</ol>

    // placing one in each using a class did not work,
    // probably because of the way that the ctx object
    // works in a canvas
