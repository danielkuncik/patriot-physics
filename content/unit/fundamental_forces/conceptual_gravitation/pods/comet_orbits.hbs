<h4>
    Comet Basics
</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Comets are balls of dust, rock, and ice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comets remain inside the solar system.
        Most of the time, comets are in the farthest away areas of the solar system: the Kuiper Belt
        and the Oort Cloud.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comets stay away from the sun for many years, then very quickly swing around the sun.
        Their orbit is highly elliptical, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse.
    </li>
    <li>
        When comets swing around the sun, they appear to humans for a few brief weeks.
        Then, they return to the Kuiper Belt or Oor Cloud for many years.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Comet Tails
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Comets only have a <emph>tail</emph> when they are near the sun,
        the rest of the time, they are just a ball.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <emph>tail</emph> appears because ice is melting and flying off the comet as they are near the sun.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comets do not fly across the sky. Like everything else in the solar system,
        they appear in different points of the sky each night, in a pattern that makes sense
        only if you look at the solar system as a whole.
    </li>
    <li>
        The tail is <strong>NOT</strong> behind the comet.
        The direction of the tail is always pointing away from the sun,
        irrespective of what direction the comet is moving.
    </li>
</ul>

        The picture below shows comet Neowise, which was visible in the year 2020.<br>

                From the picture, can you tell which direction the comet is moving?
                If so, indicate it.

            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = 'You can tell from both the sunset and the tail of the comet that it is beneath the comet.'>
                From the picture, can you tell where the sun is? If so, indicate it.
                (There may be more than one way to tell!)

<h4>
    Comet Orbit Energy
</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        As the comet moves around the sun,
        it has a constant amount of energy.
        This energy exchanges between kinetic energy gravitational
        potential energy as the comet orbits the sun;.
    </li>
    <li>
        The comet moves <emph>faster</emph> when it is <strong>close</strong> to the sun
        and <emph>slower</emph> when it is <strong>far away</strong> from the sun.
        Whenever it is moving faster, it has more kinetic energy.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the comet is farther away from the sun,
        the comet**  has <strong>more</strong> gravitational potential energy.
        When the comet is closer to the sun, it has <strong>less</strong>
        gravitational potential energy.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    **Technically, gravitational potential energy is held not by the comet
    but by the system containing both the comet and the sun.
    This issue is explored in depth in <a href = '/pod/bf8c2f0e-1461-4eb0-b499-0ec73f4ddc56'>another pod</a>,
