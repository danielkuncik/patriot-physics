  Dimensional Analysis
</h3>

<p>
  Dimensional analysis is a method of treating
  the units in a problem as though they are numbers.
  Understanding dimensional analysis is key to understanding
  how physics equations work, but it is a very good practical tool for helping
  to solve problems. Most students know about how dimensional analysis
  can be used to solve conversion problems.
  However, it are also a very powerful tool for algebraic problems.
  In this class, you are <emph>required</emph> to demonstrate that you have
  correctly solved a problem using dimensional anlaysis.

<h5>
  Steps
</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    Start by thinking of the equation as a collection of separate terms
    being added together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replace each variable with the SI unit for that variable.
    Ignore numbers such as "2" or "1/2."
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply exponents, then multiply and divide all variables.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any terms that are added or subtracted must be the same unit.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the end, if all terms are the same unit, the equation is dimensionally correct.
  </li>
</ol>

    There are <strong>three</strong>
    terms in the Definition of Acceleration.
    Demonstrate that the Definition of Acceleration is dimensionally
    correct by showing that each of the three terms has the same unit
    (m/s).
  </li>
  <li class = 'question'>
    There are <strong>three</strong>
    terms in the King of Kinematic Equations.
    Demonstrate that the King of Kinematic Equations is dimensionally
    correct by showing that each of the three terms has the same unit
    (meters).
  </li>
  <li class = 'question'>
    There are <strong>three</strong>
    terms in the No-Time Equation.
    Demonstrate that the No-Time Equation is dimensionally
    correct by showing that each of the three terms has the same unit
    (m^2/s^2).
  </li>
  <li class = 'question'>
    The Average velocity equation is more complicated:
    <ol class = 'subQuestionList'>
      <li class = 'subQuestion'>
        Replace each variable in the equation with its SI unit.
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion'>
        Does your equation have a section that looks like "m/s - m/s"?
        Any two variables with the same unit may be combined.
        Therefore, two variables with units of m/s may be subtracted,
        and they make another variable with units of m/s.
        So, replace the therm "m/s - m/s" with a single "m/s".
        (And whatever you do, don't make it a zero!)
      </li>
      <li class = 'subQuestion'>
        Now, show the equation is dimensionally correct.
      </li>
