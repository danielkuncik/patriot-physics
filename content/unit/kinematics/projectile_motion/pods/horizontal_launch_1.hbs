    In this section, we will explore problems in which an object is
    fired from some height with horizontal velocity.
    In this event, we will need to use the principle of two-dimensional motion.
</p>

<h5>
    Principle of Two Dimensional Motion
</h5>
<p class = 'definition'>
    When an object is moving in two dimensions,
    the motion in one dimension does not affect the motion
    in the other dimension.

<h5>
  Standard Horizontal Launch Problems:
</h5>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = '37.1 m'>
    A car drives off of a cliff that is 30 meters tall at a horizontal speed of 15 m/s.
    How far does it travel before striking the ground?
    <br>
    Here is how the information translates into physics quantities:
    <ul>
      <li>The horizontal velocity is 15 m/s. This is the speed the car was going when it went off the cliff.</li>
      <li>The initial vertical velocity is 0. The car is not moving vertically when it flies off the cliff.</li>
      <li>
        The vertical displacement is -30 m. This is how far it travels vertically before striking the ground.
        This value is negative because the displacement is <emph>downward</emph>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The vertical acceleration is -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
        This value is negative because the acceleration is <emph>downward</emph>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The quantity that the problem is looking for is <emph>horizontal displacement</emph>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Use the table below to find all of the unknown quantities.
    <div class = 'horizontalLaunchTable'></div>
    <br>
    Write the final answer (the horizontal displacement) here:
  </li>

  <li class = 'question' data-answer = '63.9 m'>
    A car drives off of a cliff that is 50 meters tall at a horizontal speed of 20 m/s.
    How far does it travel before striking the ground?
    <br>
    Here is how the information translates into physics quantities:
    <ul>
      <li>The horizontal velocity is 20 m/s. This is the speed the car was goign when it went off the cliff.</li>
      <li>The initial vertical velocity is 0. The car is not moving vertically when it flies off the cliff.</li>
      <li>
        The vertical displacement is -50 m. This is how far it travels vertically before striking the ground.
        This value is negative because the displacement is <emph>downward</emph>.
      </li>

<h5>
  Conceptual Questions
</h5>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'In the vertical dimension, the object is accelerating. In the horizontal dimension, it is moving with a constant velocity.'>
    Why are there four equations available to use in the vertical dimension,
    but only one available in the horizontal dimension?
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'Time. Time is not connected to you position in space.'>
    Which is the only quantity that is the same in both dimensions? Why?
  </li>
  <li class = 'question' data-answer = 'Because it is both moving downward and accelerating downward.'>
    Why are the velocity and acceleration in the vertical dimension negative?
  </li>
</ol>
