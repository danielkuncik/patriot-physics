<p class = 'introduction'>
    When you have only one light bulb,
    there is only one way to connect it:
    connect oen side of the bulb to one side of the battery,
    and the other side of the bulb to the other side of the battery.
    But when you have two light bulbs, there are two different ways to connect
    the two light bulbs
    called <strong>series</strong> and <strong>parallel</strong>.
    In this pod, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each.

    There are three options for completing this lab:
    with alligator clips,
    snap circuits, or virtually.
    If you are completing it in school, use snap circuits or alligator clips.
    If you are completing it at home, do so virtually, unless you your own
    snap circuit set or other electrical connections.
