    Switches are one of the fundamental components of an electrical circuit.
    It would be very annoying if you couldn't turn your lights on and off quickly!
    Also, think of a device you use every day:
    a computer keyboard. It's just a set of switches programmed to do different things.
</p>

<p class="introduction">
    Many people learning to build electrical circuits for the first time wire switches incorrectly.
    When you wire a switch incorrectly, it doesn't just work funny,
    it creates a short circuit and potentially causes a heating problem.
    In this pod, we will learn to connect switches both the correct way and the incorrect way,
    and see how they work together.

    First, two vocabulary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When two components are <strong>in series</strong>,
        they adjacent, so all current through one component goes through the other.
    </li>
    <li>
        When two components are <strong>in parallel</strong>,
        they are in a series circuit, one after the other.
    </li>
</ul>

                    Procedure and Questions
                </h5>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    All of the switches in the circuit diagrams for this lab
                    are being drawn as open switch. This is because it is much easier to see them.
                    Obviously, the point is to open and close the switch after you
                    build it to see how it works.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Start with a circuit containing
                        just a light bulb and a battery:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'simpleCircuit'></div>
                        <br>
                        Then, add a switch <emph>in series</emph>
                        with the light bulb, like this:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'switchInSeries'></div>
                        Move the switch up and down.
                        Does it work?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have an old-school throw-switch,
                        do you need to close it all the way to get
                        the light bulb to turn on?
                        How much do you need to close it?
                        Why?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now try rewiring
                        your circuit so that the switch is connected
                        to the light bulb <emph>in parallel</emph>:
                        <br>
                        <div id = 'switchInParallel'></div>
                        Try flipping the switch on and off.
                        It should still work, turning the light bulb turn
                        on and off.....but you will notice something a little strange.
                        What?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I like to call this a "reverse switch." Why does that name fit?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn the switch in parallel "on."
                        The light bulbs should now be off.
                        Is there current running? Wait for a little bit, and see if the battery gets warm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Look back at the previous lab on <a href = '/labs/shortCircuits'>short circuits</a>.
                        Why is the light bulb off when the switch is on?
                        Why is the light bulb on when the battery is off?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want a switch to properly control a light bulb,
                        do yo want to connect it in series or parallel with the light bulb?
                        Give two reasons why:
                        one reason that deals with safety and another with making your circuit easy to understand.

                        Why is the light bulb on when the battery is off?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want a switch to properly control a light bulb,
                        do yo want to connect it in series or parallel with the light bulb?
                        Give two reasons why:
                        one reason that deals with safety and another with making your circuit easy to understand.
