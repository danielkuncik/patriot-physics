<p class="introduction">
    In a previous pod, we looked at dragging a block
    at an angle on a frictionless surface or a surface
    with kinetic friction.
    In this pod, we will consider a surface with <strong>static friction</strong>.
    As with a box pulled horizontally under static friction,
    analyzing this situation involves a conditional:
    you first need to determine if the block moves or not,
    and other factors will change based on that result.

    Part 1: Review: Pulling a box horizontally with static friction
</h3>

<h5>
    Forces
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        Gravity:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Magnitude: \( F_g = m g \)
            </li>
            <li>
                Direction: Downwards
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Normal Force:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Magnitude: Whatever is necessary to balance other forces
            </li>
            <li>
                Direction: Perpendicular to the surface (upwards in this case)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Applied Force:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Magnitude: Given
            </li>
            <li>
                Direction: Given
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
        Static Friction: applied if box moves
        <li>
            Magnitude: Whatever is necessary to balance other horizontal forces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Direction: Whatever is necessary to balance other horizontal forces.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Kinetic Friction:
        (Applied if box moves)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Magnitude: \( F_{fr} = \mu_k F_N \)
            </li>
            <li>
                Direction: Opposite direction of motion of the block
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>
    Determining if a block moves:
</h5>

<ol>
    <li>
        Determine the magnitude of gravitational forces and normal force.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the <emph>maximum value of static friction</emph> which is given by
        \( F_{fr} \leq \mu_s F_N \)
    </li>
    <li>
        If the applied force exceeds the maximum static friction, the block begins moving.
        Otherwise, it does not.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the box moves, kinetic friction acts on the block.
        If the box does not move, static friction acts on the block.
        Make sure to know that \( \mu_s F_N \) is NOT the magnitude of static friction,
        it is the maximum magnitude. The magnitude of static friction is what is necessary to prevent motion.
    </li>

<h3>
    New Problems: Pulling an Object at an Angle with Static Friction
</h3>

<p>
    When a box is pulled at an angle, there are three conditions:
    the box could not move, the box could move horizontally,
    or the box could be pulled upward off the ground!
    See the flowchart below:
</p>

<img src = '/podAssets/dynamics/two_dimensional_dynamics/dragging_at_angle_2_flowchart.png' height = '600px' width ='auto' />

<p class="directions">
    For full credit on each of these problems, you must clearly and carefully show your work.
    Imagine that you are not only trying to give the correct answer, but convince someone who doesnâ€™t believe you that you have the correct answer.
    <br>
    Whenever you use a formula,
    you must write the formula before plugging values in.
    After plugging values in, write those values before completing
    any numerical operations.
    <br>
    Free-body Diagrams should be created with the following conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each force should be clearly labeled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Components should be drawn separately from the free-body diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
            The length of each arrow should correlate roughly to the relative magnitude of each force.
