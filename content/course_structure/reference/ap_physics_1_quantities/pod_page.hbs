<h3>
    Note on vectors and scalars:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Every quantity is a vector or a scalar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Vectors have both magnitude and direction, where scalars have only magnitude.
    </li>
    <li>
        All vectors are written with an arrow over them.
    </li>
    <li>
        The magnitude of each vector is a scalar, and can be written as the vector in absolute value signs or the vector without an arrow.
    </li>
    <li>
        All vectors can be broken into components, which are typically written as the vector with \( x \) and \( y \) subscripts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Vector components are scalars.

                Note: In most the AP Physics 1 curriculum, because it is an algebra-based physics class, acceleration is typically a constant variable
                and it is not necessary to distinguish between acceleration and average acceleration. However, it is good to know that this distinction exists.

            <li>
                It can be any magnitude up to some maximum magnitude given by \( \mu_s F_N \). If the force(s) opposed to static friction exceed its maximum value, an object will begin sliding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: The maximum value of static friction is always greater than kinetic friction between the same two surfaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: The actual magnitude of static friction will rarely, if ever, equal its maximum value.

            <li>
                Note: the word "sliding" and not "moving" is used in the official definition of static friction. There are situations when an object moves but does not slide, such as a book on a table that is being carried.

                        In an object-planet system, the gravitational force pulling the object downwards is an internal force

                        In more elementary physics classes, gravitational potential energy is often referred to as "energy contained in height,"
                        however, it is more proper to say, "energy contained in the distance between the object and the planet."

                Gravitational potential energy for the object-planet system is equal to an object mass,

                        Gravitational potential energy must always be defined relative to some zero-point height

                    <li>
                        On the AP formula sheet, to remove the reliance on zero-point height, gravitational field is given
                        as a formula only relating changes in energy and the vertical componet of position:
                        \( \Delta U_g = m g \Delta y \).

                These formulas apply only when an object is near the surface of a planet for the duration of an analysis.
                If this is not the case, the above formula for universal gravitational potential energy must be used.
