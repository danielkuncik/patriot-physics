    The ballistic pendulum is a <strong>cannonical</strong> physics problem
    (one every physics student sees)
    that combines the use of the conservation of energy with the conservation of momentum.
    It is a device that could be used to determine the speed of a moving bullet
    by firing that bullet into a pendulum.
    In this pod, we will break down how to solve the problem in steps.
