<h4>
    Number 1:
</h4>
<p>
    A bullet of mass 250 grams moving at a speed 55 m/s strikes
    a pendulum of mass 3000 grams that is stationary.
    When the bullet strikes the pendulum, they stick together,
    and the pendulum begins to rise.
</p>

<p>
    Determine the height to which the pendulum rises to 2 significant figures of accuracy.
    The answer may or may not be a realistic value.

<h4>
    Number 2
</h4>

<p>
    A bullet of mass 80 grams moving at a velocity of 33 m/s strikes
    a pendulum of unknown mass that is stationary.
    When the bullet strikes the pendulum, they stick together,
    and the pendulum begins to rise.
    It rises 9 centimeters before it stops moving.
