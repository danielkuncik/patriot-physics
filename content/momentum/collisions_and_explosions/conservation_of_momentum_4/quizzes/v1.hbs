    Solve the momentum problem below using the table provided.
    If you prefer to solve the problem by deriving a formula than the tables,
    you must <strong>explicitly</strong> write the formula you derived
    and show how you used it for full credit.
    No credit will be awarded for answers without explicitly shown work.
</p>

<p class="directions">
    Also, please write the final answer after filling out each table.

<p>
    A cannon with a mass of 500. kg
    fires a cannonball with a mass of 4.0 kg
    at a speed of 250 m/s.
    Both are at rest before the explosion.
    Fill out the table below in order to determine the
    recoil speed of the cannon.
</p>

<div id = 'explosionTable'></div>

<div class="bigSpace"></div>

<p>
    After filling out the table, please write and circle speed of the cannon after the collision.
</p>

<script>
    let explosionTable = new MomentumTable();
    explosionTable.setNameOfObjects('cannon', 'cannonball');
    explosionTable.makeExplosionTable();
    $("#explosionTable").append(explosionTable.draw(500,500));
