<p>
    In previous pods, we learned to use the formula for universal gravitation:
    $$
    F_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2}
    $$
    to determine the strength of the force of gravity between two objects.
    This formula is a universal formula, used to determine the strength
    of gravity between any two objects, anywhere in the universe, at any time.
    Of course, the main relevance of gravity in our own lives
    is as simply a force that pulls you downward (towards the center of the earth).
    This force is caused by the gravitational attraction between
    yourself and the earth.
    We will focus on that force in this pod.

<ol class="questionList">
    <li class="question" data-answer = '489 N'>
        A person is standing on planet earth.
        The person has a mass of 60 kg.
        The earth has a mass of \( 5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{ kilograms} \)
        and a radius of \( 6.378 \times 10^6 \text{ meters} \).
        <ol class="subQuestionList">
            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = 'picture'>
                Draw a picture (obviously not to scale), of the person on planet earth,
                and on that picture, label the radius of earth.
            </li>
            <p>
                Because the person has mass and the earth has mass,
                the person and the earth are attracted, and their attraction
                is given by the formula:
                $$
                F_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2}
                $$
                In this particular context, what do each
                of these variables mean?

            <ul>

                    \( m_1 \) is the mass of the person, which is 60 kg.

                <li>
                    \( m_2 \) is the mass of the earth, which is \( 5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{ kilograms} \).

                <li>
                    \( d \) represents the distance between the person's center of mass
                    and the earth's center of mass.
                    In this case, it means the distance between the person and the center of the earth,
                    which is the earth's radius \( 6.378 \times 10^6 \text{ meters} \).

<h4>
    Basic Problems:
</h4>

<p class = 'directions'>
    Use the formula and reasoning about planets in order to solve
    each of the problems below.
</p>

<ol class = 'questionList'>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Determine the force of gravity (weight) pulling a 80 kg person on the surface of Venus.
        <div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Determine the force of gravity (weight) pulling a 60 kg person on the surface of Io.
        <div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Determine the force of gravity (weight) pulling a 75 kg person who is on a platform* on the surface of Neptune.
        <div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>
    </li>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Determine the force of gravity (weight) pulling a 65 kg person who is on the surface of the asteroid Ceres.
        <div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    *As Neptune is a gas giant, you cannot stand on it. So imagine there's a platform above Neptune, and someone is standing on the platform.
</p>

<h4>
    Planets and Acceleration:
</h4>

<p>
    Imagine a person is on planet earth and jumps off of a diving board.
    The only force acting on the person at this point is gravity.
    This is called <strong>free-fall</strong>.
    The person's free-body diagram is very simple:
</p>
<div id = 'freeFallFBD'></div>

<script>
    let freeFallFBD = fastFBD([['down','gravity']]);
    $("#freeFallFBD").append(freeFallFBD.draw(200));
</script>

<p>
    Use the formula for universal gravitation \( F_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2} \) to determine
    the force attracting the person to the earth.
    Assume, as before, that the variable \( d \) is equal to the radius of the earth.
    The height of the diving board is negligible.
</p>
<div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>

<p>
    Because there is only one force acting on the person,
    that force is the NET FORCE.
    Write the net force below:
    $$
    \Sigma F =
    $$
</p>

<p>
    Now, use the formula Newton's Second Law \( \Sigma F = ma \) to determine the acceleration of the person.
</p>

<div class = 'formulaBoxDiv'></div>
