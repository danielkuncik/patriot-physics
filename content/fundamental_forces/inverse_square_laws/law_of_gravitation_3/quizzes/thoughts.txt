I think that I should take the Newton's Third Law portions of these quizzes out?
or should I keep them in?

- it feels relevant to the topic, and at the same time goes in a different direction

- it gets away from the central concept, which is, how to use the formula

- in any case, i feel like the quiz is too long,
and there is a seperate quiz on newton's third law and planets (but it is such an important topic and must be coered twice!)
