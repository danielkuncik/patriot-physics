1.: Copy Newton's Third Law
"Newton's Third Law states that whenever A exerts a force on B, B exerts a force on A with equal magnitude and opposite direction."

2a. Force of gravitation between person and planet
v1: m = 45 kg; Neptune => 507 N (620. N in the 2022 version)
v2: m = 55 kg; Venus => 487 N
v3: m - 65 kg; Mercury => 240 N

2b. Draw diagram of person and planet showing forces

2c. Explain why the diagram is consistent with Newtons' Third Law.

2d. Explain which force is irrelevant.

(c and d swapped in 2022 version)


3. Explain the relevance of the radius of the planets by referring to the formula
