<p class = 'directions'>
  Below are the approximate definitions of 11 different types of energy.
    Write the <strong>name</strong> of each type of energy.
</p>


<ol>
  <li>Energy of an object that has been stretched or compressed</li>
  <li>Energy within a moving oscillation of matter (mechanical wave)</li>
  <li>Energy contained within a battery, capable of having an exothermic reaction that creates an electrical current</li>
  <li>Energy of an object spinning around</li>
  <li>Energy contained within an unstable nucleus</li>
  <li>Energy of an object that is high up and able to fall downward</li>
  <li>Energy of an object moving forward</li>
  <li>Energy of randomly moving molecules</li>
  <li>Energy within a moving oscillation of electric and magnetic fields</li>
  <li>Energy contained in molecules capable of having an exothermic reaction</li>
  <li>Energy of electric current</li>
</ol>

<p class = 'directions'>
    Using the table below, classify each of the 11 <strong>names</strong>
    of different types of energy into two broad categories:
    kinetic energy and potential energy.
