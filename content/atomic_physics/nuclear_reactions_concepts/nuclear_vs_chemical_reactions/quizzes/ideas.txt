In Physics class, Johnny's physics teacher tells him to draw out a nuclear reaction undergone by radon.....
Imagine a student says, 'That cannot be. My chemistry teacher told me that Radon is a noble gas which doesn't have reactions?'
How do you respond?
- Your chemistry teacher is wrong; radon oes in fact undergo reactions frequently.
- Your physics teacher is wrong; radon does not undergo reactions.
- The physics and chemistry teacher are discussing different types of reactions.
-


Which statement describes a true fact describing the difference between chemical and nuclear reactions?
- In a chemical reaction


The statement "During a ________ reaction, an element can become a different element."
Which word could go in the blank.
A. "chemical"
B. "nuclear"
C. "chemical" or "nuclear"
D. No word can go there, as elements can never become different element.



For each of the following reactions, determine whether this would be a chemical reaction or a nuclear reaction:
- A tree burns

- Uranium slowly decays

- A nucleus splits into two

- The reaction that produces energy within the sun

- Chlorine and Sodium react to produce salt


There is a statement like, 'Mankind has discovered how to split the atom......'
Whether or not that is true, what is a more precise way to write it
- how to split the 'nucleus' of the atom....
- the statement is perfectly correct as written
- the statement is an exaggeration and shouldn't be written at all
