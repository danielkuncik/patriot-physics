A geiger counter measures:



When you take out a geiger counter and turn it on, you hear a few intermediate pings every second or so.
What is this measuring?
- ambient nuclear radiation


When you put a geiger counter next to an old "fiestaware" plate, it begins pinging very aggresively. Why?
- The fiestaware plate contains materials that are undergoing nuclear decay

- the fiestaware plate contains materials that are undergoing chemical reactions

- The fiestaware plate is giving off X-rays and gamma rays.


A geiger counter in the chernobyl zone pings more frequently than in a classroom in Massachusetts. WHy?
- There is more material undergoign nuclear decay ambient in the chernobyl zone
