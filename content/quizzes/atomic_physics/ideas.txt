I need to add a quiz on the actual prcinples behind nuclear decay

- conservation of mass
- conservation of charge



this includes questions such as
'how many electrons are in the nuclues'

and
'what is the charge of the nucleus'


these mulitple choice quizzes are a good idea
and self-grading quizzes


define the terms [i think these are already in a quiz]
- daughter nucleus
- alpha particle
- beta particle etc.
