        A car is capable of moving with an acceleration of 4.00 m/s/s.
        If it begins from rest and accelerates at that rate,
        how long does it take the car to travel 30.0 meters?

        A car is moving at a speed of 23.0 m/s.
        It speeds up while moving a distance of 19.1 meters
        in a time of only 0.620 seconds.
        What is its final speed?
