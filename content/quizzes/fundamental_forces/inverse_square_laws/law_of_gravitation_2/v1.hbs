<ol>
    <li>
        A person with a mass of 55 kg is standing on the surface
         of Venus.
        Use the Law of Universal Gravitation to
        determine the force of gravity between this person and Venus.
    </li>
    <li>
        A person with a mass of 80 kg is standing on a platform
        on the outer edge of Jupiter.
        Use the Law of Universal Gravitation to
        determine the force of gravity between this person and Jupiter.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain briefly why the radius of the planets was relevant to these
        problems by referring to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Person A is at sea level on planet earth,
        while person B is 100 m above sea level.

            <li>
                Who experiences a stronger gravitational pull and why?
                Refer to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation in your answer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Is this difference very important? Explain why or why not.
