        Imagine you are having a conversation with your very very smart 8 year old
        cousin about what it would be like to travel to Antarctica.
        She says,
        "If everything always falls <emph>down</emph>,
        and you are standing on the South Pole,
        won't you just fall off the earth head-first?"
        You assure her that it is totally safe to stand on the south pole
        (except that it's really cold), but she doesn't believe you.
        How could you explain to her how it actually works?

        What is the true definition of gravity?

        By referring to the <emph>true</emph> definition of gravity,
        explain why something falls down when you drop it.
