        Why are the terms "up" and "down" actually incomplete,
        and with what can they be replaced?
        Use a diagram in answering this question.

        Imagine you are having a conversation with your very very smart 8 year old
        cousin about what it would be like to travel to Antarctica.
        She says,
        "If everything always falls <emph>down</emph>,
        and you are standing on the South Pole,
        won't you just fall off the earth head-first?"
        You assure her that it is totally safe to stand on the south pole
        (except that it's really cold), but she doesn't believe you.
        How could you explain to her how it actually works?
        For full credit, include a diagram, and refer to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
        and your answer for #1.
        (Remember that she is very very smart.)
        Please include a <strong>diagram</strong> in your answer and provide an explanation
        that is <emph>specific</emph> to the south pole.
        (It is not enough to say that it is because of gravity).
