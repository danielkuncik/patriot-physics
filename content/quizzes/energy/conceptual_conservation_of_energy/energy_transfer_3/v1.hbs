  For each situation, draw an energy transfer diagram.
    Your energy transfer diagram should include a type of energy,
    and should indicate what object or situation 'holds' that energy.
  Your energy transfer diagram should begin with <strong>sunlight</strong>
  and end at the point indicated.
    Fore full credit, you must indicate between types of kinetic energy.
