    A piano falls off a short shelf.
    The shelf is 0.51 m and the piano strikes the ground with a speed of 2.83 m/s.
    If falls quickly but experiences significant air resistance.
    (Note that all values in this problem are not necessarily realistic but do follow appropriate laws and formulas.)
    First, determine the mass of the piano
    Then, fill out the following table to describe how the energy of the piano-earth system changes over time:

<p>
    Draw a <strong>qual</strong>itative graph with "energy" on the y-axis and "distance fallen" on the x-axis.
    Draw three lines on the graph showing how
    kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and total energy <strong>inside the system</strong>
    change as the piano falls.
    Note that the third line of the graph shows the total energy <strong>inside the system</strong>,
    which does not include thermal energy.
