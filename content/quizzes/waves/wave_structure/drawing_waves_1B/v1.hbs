    This quiz must be taken on graph paper!
    If you don't have any, use a ruler to turn lined paper into graph paper
    or print some out <a href = 'https://www.waterproofpaper.com/graph-paper/graph-paper-half-inch.pdf'>here</a>.

<p class="directions">
    Draw each of the waves below with the specified wavelength.
    They can have any amplitude.
    For full credit, your wave must be the general shape of a wave,
    and it must include at least 3 crests and 3 troughs.

<ol>
    <li>
        Draw a transverse wave with an amplitude of 3 boxes.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid1'></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Draw a transverse wave with an amplitude of 1 box.
        <br>
        <div id = 'grid2'></div>
    </li>
</ol>
