        A person is pressing a book to the right against the wall and the book is not moving.
        The book has a mass of 2.50 kg, and the coefficient of static friction between the
        book and the wall is 0.400,

                Draw a qualitative free-body diagram which names each of the forces acting on the book (there are 4)
                and names the agent causing that force.

                Determine the magnitude of the force of gravity acting on the book.

                Determine the minimum force with which the person must press the book
                to make it stay in place and not move.

                Assuming the person is pressing the book with this minimum force,

        A person is falling with a speed of 10.0 m/s and is 20.0 meters above the ground.
        when he grabs onto a pole.
        The man has a mass of 80.0 kg.
        His hands press on the pole with a force of 90.0 Newtons,
        and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the man's hands and the pole is 0.300.

            <li>
                Draw a qualitative free-body diagram which names each of the forces acting on the man (there are 3)
                and names the agent causing that force.

            <li>
                Determine the magnitude of each force acting on the man.
                Make sure that you write each equation you use before plugging numbers in.
                Write 1-2 sentences on how you determined the force of kinetic friction.

            <li>
                Determine the magnitude of downward acceleration of the man.
                In 1-2 sentences, compare this magnitude of acceleration to what it would be if he did not grab the pole,
                and, dynamically, why it is slower.

                Determine the speed at which the man will strike the ground.
