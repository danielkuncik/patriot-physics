<p>
    Somebody throws an ball
    directly upward into the air.
    It rises high into the air, then begins
    to fall down to the ground.
</p>

<p>
    Create a qualitative graph of energy-time for the ball.
    On the graph, include three different lines, each with their own label.
    The three lines should show the kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and total energy of the ball.
    The graph should encompass the entire time from when the ball is thrown upward to when it eventually falls down to the ground.

    let myGraph = new QuantitativeGraph(0,10,0,10,3);
    myGraph.labelAxes('Time', 'Energy');
    $("#graphDiv").append(myGraph.drawCanvas(1200,400));
