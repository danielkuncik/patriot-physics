<p>
    Imagine that a roller coaster car of mass 100 kg
    drives up and down the following roller coaster.
    It begins at point A (height = 90 m) with a speed of 33 m/s.
    Assume the roller coaster car moves with no energy
    being added to or subtracted from the system.

        Fill out the table below to analyze the energy of the car-earth system.
        Note that there are mulitple correct answers based on which point is selected
        as the zero-point height.

    <li>
        At point C, the car should have a speed of 33 m/s.
        Explain this in words without resorting to calculations.
