    A horizontal spring with spring constant \( k \) and equilibrium length \( x_0 \).
    The horizontal spring is attached to a mass \( m \) and is at rest at its equilibrium length.
    Somebody pulls the spring backwards until its length is \( \left( A + x_0 \right) \), then lets go.
    Assume that \( A < x_0 \).
    Assume no work is done on the mass-spring system after the person lets go.
    Determine a function \( v \left( x \right) \) for the speed of the mass in terms of its horizontal position.
    Your function should include constant values \( k \), \( x_0 \), \( m \), and \( A \).
    Note that the symbol \( A \) is used to indicate the amplitude of an oscillating system.
    Determine the values
    \( v \left( x = x_0 \right) \),
    \( v \left( x = x_0 + A \right) \),
    \( v \left( x = x_0 - A \right) \),
    and argue that these values give the results you would expect.
