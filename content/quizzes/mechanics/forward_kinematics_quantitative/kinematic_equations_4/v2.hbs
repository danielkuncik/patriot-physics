    Use each the kinematic equations to solve the problem below.
    The car does not have a constant acceleration for the entire interval,
    but the interval can be broken into smaller intervals in which the car does have
    a constant acceleration.
    Please copy each equation that you use <i>before</i> plugging numbers into the equation.

<p>
    A plane is taxiing on the moving on the ground at a constant speed of 6 m/s until it travels 300 meters.
    It then needs to stop for 100 seconds while waiting for its opportunity to take off.
    The plane starts accelerating at a rate of 1.5 m/s<sup>2</sup> until it reaches a speed of 120 m/s.
    But there is a sudden emergency! The pilot slams the breaks and the plane stops in a time of 20 seconds.

<p>
    Determine the average speed of the car over the entire interval.
