<p>
    Two cars have a collision.
    They were moving in the same direction when one car rear-ended another.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Before the collision:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Car A has a mass of 20 kg and a velocity of 5 m/s.
            </li>
            <li>
                Car B has a mass of 15 kg and a velocity of 3 m/s.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        After the collision:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Car A has a velocity of 2 m/s in the same direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Car B has an unknown velocity.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Fill out the table below to determine the velocity of Car B after the collision:
