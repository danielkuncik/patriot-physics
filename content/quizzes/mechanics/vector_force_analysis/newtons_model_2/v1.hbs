    Each of the questions below require you to draw a free-body diagram and to
    create an argument for the free-body diagram you selected.
    For full credit, you must refer <emph>explicitly</emph> to either <strong>Newton's First Law</strong>
    or <strong>Newton's Second Law</strong> as they are explained in the table above.
    If you chose to refer to Newton's Second Law,
    you must refer to the table above, <emph>not</emph> the equation form of Newtons' Second Law.
    (The purpose is to think about the law conceptually rather than mathematically for these questions.)

    <li class="bigQuestion">
        A person lifts a box with a weight of 200 Newtons at a constant speed.
        The only forces to consider on the box are the contact force caused by the person's arms
        and the weight of the box.
        Draw an appropriate free-body diagram of the box. You may pick any appropriate magnitude of the contact force.
        By referring explicitly to Newton's First or Second Law as described in the table above,
        explain why you picked the free-body diagram you did.
    </li>
    <li class="mediumQuestion">
        A person is lifting a weight of 500 Newtons vigorously, so much that the weight is accelerating at he lifts it.
        The only forces to consider on the weight are the contact force caused by the person's arms
        and the weight of the weight.
        Draw an appropriate free-body diagram of the weight. You may pick any appropriate magnitude of the contact force.
        By referring explicitly to Newton's First or Second Law as described in the table above,
        explain why you picked the free-body diagram you did.

        A person is trying to hold up a weight of 800 N, but the weight is unfortunately accelerating downwards.
        The only forces to consider on the weight are the contact force caused by the person's arms

        Draw an appropriate free-body diagram of the weight. You may pick any appropriate magnitude of the contact force.
