<p>
    Two cars collide into each other.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Before the collision:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Car A has a mass of 2000 kg and a velocity of 8 m/s.
            </li>
            <li>
                Car B has a mass of 2200 kg and a velocity of 11 m/s.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        After the collision, the two cars stick together.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Fill out the table below to determine the speed of the
    cars after the collision.
</p>

<div id = 'momentumTable'></div>

<p>
    After filling out the table, please explicitly write the final answer.
</p>

<script>
    let momentumTable = new MomentumTable();
    momentumTable.makeTotallyInelasticCollision();
    $("#momentumTable").append(momentumTable.draw(500,500));
