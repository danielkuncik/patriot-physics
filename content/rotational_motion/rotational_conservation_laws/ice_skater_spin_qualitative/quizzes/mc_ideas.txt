What is the formula for angular momentum?


What is the formula for the rotational inertia of a point mass?

Is the angular momentum conserved in this situation?
- yes, becuase angular momentum is always conserved
- yes, because the net torque acting on the robot is zero
- no, because the rotational inertia of the robot changes
- no, because the angular velocity of the robot changes


When the robots raises his arms, what happesn to rotational inertia
- it stays the same, because the robot's mass does not change
- it increases, because the robot is stronger
- it
[more, including the correct answer]

What is observed when the robot lifts his arms
- nothing, (other than the arms lifting)
- the robot appears to spin slower
- the robot appears to spin faster
- [another]


What is the relationship between angular velocity and rotational inertia in this situation?
- direct
- inverse
- direct square
- they have no relationship
- inverse square




The second robot experiences:

A. very little effect, because the arms have no mass
B. exactly the same effec,t ebcause angular momentum is still conserved
C. the same effect, becuase the rotatioanl inertia still increases
D. the opposite effect,
