How many days are in the year 2032?



How many seconds are in the year 2032 [assuming no leap seconds]?


What is the angular velocity of the earth in its revolution?


The earth rotates counterclockwise as viewed from above the north pole.
What is the direction of the earth's angular velocity?
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the north pole to the center of the earth
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the south pole to the center of the earth
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the center of the earth to the intersection of the equator
and the prime meridian
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the center of the earth to the interaction
of the equator and in the international date line



If the earth were slowing down**, what would be the direction of its angular acceleration?
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the north pole to the center of the earth
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the south pole to the center of the earth
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the center of the earth to the intersection of the equator
and the prime meridian
- the direction of an arrow pointing from the center of the earth to the interaction
of the equator and in the international date line


Some years have a single leap second, others do not.
Leap seconds are not added regularly, but are determined by an international body
of earth scientists.
How many significant figures are appropriate for the answer to this problem?



A mars day has a length of one earth day, plus 37 minutes.
A mars year is 687 earth days.
Imagine that a wizard wanted to slow mars to a length of one earth day plus 60 minutes
over the course of a single mars year.
What would be the magnitude of the angular acceleration of Mars during this time?
[Note we will represented the answer as a positive number, the direction of angular acceleration would be opposite
the direction of Mars's angular velocity.]
Write the answer to 3 significant figures of accuracy.
