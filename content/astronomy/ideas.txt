Astronomy Basics:
- (what's not called intuitive astronomy)
this should include the pods currently there
on higher levels, it should include several pods on cosmic address and some of the information on different levels of the cosmic address


Cosmological Theories
- this should go through the big bang theory, its history, and its current state


Basic earth science?
- shoud this be included in astronomy


What other pods shoudl i include?
- more advanced history
- space travel
- more advanced study of planets and moons etc.
- CERTAINLY solar astronomy needs to be included

- a unit called 'solar astronomy'
- a unit called 'inside the solar system??? but i think it would be difficult to make this a combined whole and not just lots of disconnected facts
