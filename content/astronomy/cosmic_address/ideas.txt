I am thinking that cosmic address should be it's own quiz ladder


Level 1
- basically identify well known things


Level 2
- cosmic address rules


Level 3:
- precise definitions of portions of the cosmic address
- information on less well known objects in the cosmic address
- identifying the 'levels' of certain things
- writing cosmic address of non-earth objects


Levels 4 and 5?
- i feel like forwards and backwards cosmic address should merge here
- backwards cosmic address??? [does that go here or somewhere else]
- length scales

level 5:
- cosmic address of a quark with length scales?
