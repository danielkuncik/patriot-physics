The celestial sphere is composed of objects in the night sky that:
- move randomly locations each night
- stay in the same location each night
- move throughout each night, but stay in the same location relative to each other
- move throughout the night, but stay in the same location relative to the sun


The term "celestial" is derived from the Latin word for:
- heaven
- hell
- ruler
- country


The star polaris, visible in the northern hemisphere moves very very little each night. this is because
- the north pole of earth points directly at it
- it is held is place by a web of black holes

The stars of the celestial sphere appear to mvoe in circles.
Ancieny european astronomers knew this.
To the best of our knowledge, their explanation was:
- circles are considered the perfect shape, and the heavens are perfect
- the stars are orbitting the earth
- the earth is turning and the stars move relative to us
-

Which of those explanations it he correct answer?


How do stars appear to move in the night sky?
- They stay still each night.
- In circles with no clear pattern.
- In circles around the moon.
- In circles around the North Star.



The stars move in circles around:
- a the earth
- the sun
- the star polaris
- the point of maximum gravitational field



An object that moves into different locations of the celestial sphere each night was called a
- planetus



Why do the planets appear to move within the celestial spere, but the stars do not?
