I discover a new galaxy (called, THe Kuncik Galaxy) in the constellation Cassiopea. This means:

- The galaxy is located near the stars of Cassiopea.
- The galaxy is located in the same direction as the stars of Cassiopea, but is much much further away.
- The galaxy is located in the same direciton as the stars of Cassiopea, but is much much closer.
