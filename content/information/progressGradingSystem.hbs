    The Progress Grading System: Rules
</h1>


<ul>
    <li>
        You begin the term with a grade with a grade of zero,
        and zero points.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are three types of assignments:
        practice pages,
        at home assessment (homework quiz, lab report, or problem set),
        and in class quiz.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every time you complete an assignment, you earn points.
        When you earn a specified number of points, your
        grade increases by one percentage.

    </li>
    <li>
        Your grade only goes up. It does not go down.
        The only way to earn a low grade is to not earn points.
        You cannot earn a ow grade from completing assignments poorly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The curriculum is broken into tiny pieces called pods. Each pod has, attached to it,
        a practice page and an assessments.
        For most pods, the assessment is a quiz, but for some it is a lab
        report or a problem set.
        You can complete these assignments at home or in class.
    </li>
    <li>
        The pods are divided into <strong>ladders</strong>.
        The ladders build on an individual type of problem.
        For example, a level 1 pod in the momentum ladder introduces the momentum formula,
        and subsequent pods apply it to increasingly difficult problems.
        You are expected to complete the pods on a ladder in order.
        You will not complete ladders one at a time, but switch between different ladders
        as the year goes on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each pod had a level, indicating its difficulty.
        Most level 1 pods involve only plugging into a simple formula or memorizing a few definitions,
        but level 6 pods are as difficult as an advanced physics college problem set.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>practice page</strong> is a page you do to help yourself
        learn an assignment.
        They are graded for completion, effort, and following directions.
        When you complete a practice page, you earn:
        $$
        100 \times \left( level \right)
        $$
    </li>
    <li>
        Each pod has an assessment attached to it: a self quiz, a problem set, a lab report, or a memorization quiz.
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <strong>self quiz</strong> is a short quiz that you are allowed to complete
                on your own and submit using your phone.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>problem set</strong> is a longer problem you are encouraged to complete
                in a group, and turn in as an assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>lab report</strong> is an activity where you collect data as a group,
                and write an analysis of that data on your own.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>memorization quiz</strong> is a brief amount of content that must be memorized
                word for word. Memorization quizzes must be taken in class, but can be taken multiple times.
            </li>
        </ul>
        All assessments are scored out of 20. You can retake or resubmit assessments as many times as
        you want. If you resubmit an assessment, you will earn the higher grade.
        If you achieve a score of 18, 19, or 20, your score is automatically moved up to 20
        and reported as "ACE."
        When you complete an assessment, you will gain points equal to:
        $$
        200 \times \left( \text{level} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Your score}}{20} \right)
        $$
        If you complete an assignment and improve your grade, you score will be added equal tot he extra points you
        earned, but you will not be able to earn the points for each assessment multiple times.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will take <strong>in-class quizzes</strong> in class.
        The in-class quizzes are identical to the self quizzes, but you will receive
        one randomly from a pile.
        We will take in-class quizzes approximately once every other class.
        You cannot retake an in-class quiz.
        When you complete an in-class quiz, you earn points equal to:
        $$
        500 \times \left( \text{level} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Your score}}{20} \right)
        $$
    </li>
    <li>
        You may complete any assignment. However, it is not recommended for
        Honors students to complete level 1 practice pages (though it is allowed).
        It is not recommended for AP students to complete level 1 or level 2
        practice pages (though it is allowed).
        However, all students should complete level 1 and level 2 quizzes in order,
        even though they are easy for many Honors and AP students.
