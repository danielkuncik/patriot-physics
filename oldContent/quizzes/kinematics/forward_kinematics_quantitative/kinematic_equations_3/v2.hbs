        A car is driving at 15 m/s, when it sees something in front of it.
        It slows to rest in a distance of 20 meters.
        What is the acceleration of the car?

        A car is driving, probably too fast, when it sees wall a distance of 10.0 meters in front of it.
        The car tries to slow down, but it hits the wall 0.500 seconds later while moving at a speed of 8.00 m/s.
        How fast was the car moving <emph>before</emph> it started slowing down.

        You are on another planet, not earth.
        Someone drops an object from rest, and it falls a distance of 60.0 m in a time of 4.671 seconds.
        What is the free-fall acceleration on this planet?
