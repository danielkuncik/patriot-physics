        A block as a mass of 8.80 kg and is not moving.
        Somebody begins pulling the block with a force of 54.0 N to the right.
        The coefficient of <emph>kinetic</emph> friction between the block and the surface is 0.480.
        The coefficient of <emph>static</emph> friction between the block and the surface is 0.670.
