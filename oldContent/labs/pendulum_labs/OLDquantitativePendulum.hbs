<h3>
    Quantitative Pendulum Lab
</h3>

<p>
    The formula for the period of a pendulum is given by:
</p>
<p class = 'equation'>
    $$
    T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}
    $$
</p>
<p>
    In which \( T \) represents the period of the pendulum,
    \( l \) represents the length of hte pendulum from the top of the string to
    the center of mass of the bob,
    and \( g \) represents the free-fall acceleration on earth.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of this lab is to prove this formula
    and to use the resulting value to find a numerical value
    for the free-fall acceleration on earth \( g \).
</p>

<p>
    The period of a pendulum \( T \) is proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum \( l \).
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Build a pendulum. Minimize friction. Develop a way of measuring the
        period of the pendulum as accurately as you can.
    </li>
    <li>
        For at least 20 different data points, measure the length and period of the pendulum.
        It is good to take many many data points.
        You should test each length multiple times and count these as different data points.
        You should test many different lengths, from those well over a meter
        to those less than 20 centimeters.
    </li>
    <li>
        (In your lab notebook) fill out the table below.
        In this table, you compare the square root of the length to the period.
        <br>
        <div id = 'dataTable'></div>
        <br>
        This is an example! Don't fill this in. Write in your lab notebook.
        This table is just here to show you what the table in your lab notebook
        should look like.
    </li>
    <li>
        (In your lab notebook) Create a scatterplot relating the period (the independent variable)
        to the square root of the length (the dependent variable).
        Plot each point you found on your graph.
        DO NOT connect the points. DO NOT draw any lines.
        <br>
        <div id = 'dataGraph'></div>
        <br>
        This is an example! Don't fill this in. Write in your lab notebook.
        This graph is just here to show you what the graph in your lab notebook
        should look like.
    </li>
    <li>
        Notice if any of your points are outliers.
        Outliers are points that do not seem to follow the set pattern.
        Develop a logical policy for how to handle them.
        (This should have been step 1...but as we are still learning we will think
        about outliers after we have outliers to think about.)
    </li>
    <li>
        According to the formula above,
        the period is directly proportional to the square root of the length.
        Therefore, according to the theory, the graph should be an upward sloped
        line going through the origin.
        Are your data consistent with this hypothesis?

                The \( r^2 \) quantity determines what percentage
                of the variation in \( T \) is explained by variation
                on \( \sqrt{l} \). Ideally, it should be above 99%.
            </li>
            <li>
                The quantity \( b \) is the y-intercept of your
                regression line.
                To match the formula above, it should be as close as possible to zero.

        The variable \( a \) describes the slope of your line.

            <li>
                The data points should be close to the best-fit line.
                How close are they?
            </li>
            <li>
                According to the formula above, the best-fit line should go
                through the origin. How close does it come to the origin.
            </li>
        </ul>
