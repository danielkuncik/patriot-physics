Create three different types of motion graphs

- motion labs that use a stopwatch and a ruler
- motion labs that use a metronome
- motion labs using video analysis (coach my video or vernier logger pro)
(motion labs using photogates....)
(motion labs using some sort of motion detector...)


Cannon labs
- determining initial y-velocity with just one shot
- determining the optimal range
- taking piles of data
- testing the formula for range, determining initial y-velocity


[you can set up an axis here!]
