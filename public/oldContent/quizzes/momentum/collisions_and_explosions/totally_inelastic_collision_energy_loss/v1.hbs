<p>
    An object with a mass of \( m_a \) and initial velocity \( v_a \)
    collides into an object with a mass of \( m_b \) and initial velocity \( v_b \).
    They stick together and move with a speed \( v_f \).
</p>

<p>
    Prove that the total kinetic energy lost in this collision is given by
    $$
        \Delta KE = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_a m_b}{(m_a + m_b)} \left( v_a - v_b \right)^2
    $$
    Note that this expression gives the change in kinetic energy
    in terms of the masses and initial velocities, but not the final velocity.
    Note that, in order to find this expression,
    you must create very long and complex formula and then simplify them
    algebraically to a single term.
</p>

<p>
    Then, complete the following analyses:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prove the formula is dimensionally correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        Can this expression every be positive? Explain why this makes sense.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under what conditions is no kinetic energy lost?
        Explain why this is logical.
    </li>
    <li>
        How much kinetic energy is lost if \( m_a >> m_b \)?
    </li>
    <li>
        How much kinetic energy is lost if one of the two objects
        is initially stationary?
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain how this formula could be applied to either
        a head-on or rear-end collision.
        (Head-on collision: the two objects were moving in opposite directions;
        rear-end collision: the two objects were moving in the same direction.)
    </li>
</ul>



<p>
    Now derive a new formula for the proportion of energy lost in the collision:
    \( \frac{KE_f}{KE_i} \)
    in terms of \( m_a \), \( m_b \), \( v_a \), and \( v_b \).
    This expression, unlike the first, will be very complex.
    It will include many terms and cannot be simplified to a simple expression.
    Use the result to answer the next question.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Show that the expression you determined is dimensionless.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prove that if one of the objects is initially stationary
        (assume, without loss of generality, it is \( m_b \)).
        and has a mass that is insignificant relative to the other ( \( m_a >> m_b \) ),
        an insignificant amount of kinetic energy is lost.
        (For example, in the case of a truck running over a stationary pebble.)
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    The statement \( m_a >> m_b \) means that certain statements can be simplified.
    For example:
    \( m_a + m_b = m_a \).
