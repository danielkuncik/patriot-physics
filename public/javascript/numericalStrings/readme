Methods and validations for numerical strings

It is necessary in order to properly operate a computer generated and graded quiz of numerical problems

Files I will have

- miscellaneous javascript functions
- general string functions
- numerical string validations
- numerical string cleaning methods
- numerical string conversion methods
- numerical string roudnding methods
- random generation functions

- general functions for testing
- a file of all tests i am running

it will now be organized and much easier to read code!


Should all of these functions validate BEFORE I use them???
-- i feel like i need to create a class or something
