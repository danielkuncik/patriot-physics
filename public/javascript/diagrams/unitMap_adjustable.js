/*
This is a unit map that students can adjust in order to determine what their grade WOULD be if they reached
a particular point in the unit map
 */

// this needs to incorporate the back end????
// this will take some work, but it will be fun???


// its the only way to stop the endless questions about 'what will my grade be if.....'

// it really should be an html file???

// create a helper and some back end programs that get the 'unitObjectWithGrades' to the front end
