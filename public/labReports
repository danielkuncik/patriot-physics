Students can determine what lab reports to write
- for each lab report they write, they can gain more points


what makes a lab report



how labs should work =>
(similar to quizzes, they are disorganized)

every fourth day is a 'lab day'
students have opportunities to work on many different labs

- then, students can complete 'lab reports' for more points
(up to a maximum of 2000 points)
- they can complete as many as they want, but they need to complete
[some simpler labs will be difficult to write]

you can get a certain point value for each lab

= some lab reports are worth more than others


- all of the labs should be 'short'
