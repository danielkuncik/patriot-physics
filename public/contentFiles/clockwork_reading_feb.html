<p>
    Part of the homework for this weekend will be
    to re-read and briefly analyze the section of
    Edward Dolnick's <emph>The Clockwork Universe</emph>
    in which Isaac Newton finally discovers and publishes
    his Universal Law of Gravitation.
</p>


<p>
    Read Chapters 45 - 49 of The Clockwork Universe.
    Answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Chapter 45: The Apple and the Moon
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dolnick (the author) explains how Newton began believing that the
                force that caused the apple to fall extended beyond the top of the tree.
                Explain what is meant by this.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are 10 yards from a bright light, and then step to 20 yards away,
                how bright is the light now? What is this relationship called?
            </li>
            <li>
                What are some physical phenomena that exhibit inverse square laws?
            </li>
            <li>
                How did, using Newton's First Law,
                Issac Newton deduce that a force is pulling on the moon?
            </li>
            <li>
                If the moon were released from gravity, on what path would it travel?
            </li>
            <li>
                Why did Newton need to compare the distance from an apple to the center of the earth
                to the distance from the center of the earth to the moon?
            </li>
            <li>
                What motivated Newton to determine his laws of the universe?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Chapter 46: A Visit to Cambridge
        <ul>
            <li>
                According to Kepler's First Law,
                the orbits of all planets match what geometric shape?
            </li>
            <li>
                According to the story, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley
                sat down in a coffee shop in 1684 and discussed one question.
                What question?
            </li>
            <li>
                Who eventually was able to answer this question confidently and precisely?
            </li>
            <li>
                Christopher Wren, a minor character in this story,
                was England's most famous architect of his generation.
                Use Google to find at least one building he designed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Chapter 47
        <ul>
            <li>
                In Newton's response to Halley, what principles did he prove?
            </li>
            <li>
                How many books are there in the Principia (Newton's greatest work)?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Chapter 48: Trouble with Mr. Hooke
        <ul>
            <li>
                Which scientist begged Isaac Newton to publish his findings?
            </li>
            <li>
                True or False? Isaac Newton was a kind and magnanimous man
                who praised and respected all those he knew.
                Briefly explain your choice.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Chapter 49: The System of the World
        <ul>
            <li>
                How was Newton able to simplify
                large and complex objects in Book 3 of the Principia?
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the start of class,
                we have done many problems involving simple things
                like blocks and
                spheres, and more complicated things like planets,
                cars, moving people etc, all in the same way.
                Connect this method to the proof described in Book 3 of the Principia.
            </li>
            <li>
                What are some of the principles that Newton deduced from his
                laws of motion and gravitation in Book 3 in the Principia?
            </li>
            <li>
                How was the Law of Universal Gravitation different from all principles discovered before?
            </li>
            <li>
                (A silly question): The Royal Society was unable to publish the Principia
                because it had recently lost a ton of money publishing what other book?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
