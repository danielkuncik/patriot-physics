<h4>
    Extra Credit Assignment for April 2020.
</h4>


<p>
    Hello everybody.
    Because of all of the unpredictable events over the few weeks,
    the term is about to end, and some people have a grade lower than they would expect.
    There are two ways to improve this.
    one is to take the quizzes, which are now all open, and email them to me.
    The other is to complete this assignment.
    Each assignment is to watch a video, and then email some questions.
</p>

<p>
    For each assignment you complete well, you will receive 5 extra points in PowerSchool.
    (Those are five points averaged in with all other assignments, not five points towards you grade overall.)
    if you don't complete any assignments, you won't receive any extra points.
</p>

<p>
    I will accept this assignment via email until noon on Thursday 4-9-2020.
</p>
<p>
    I will accept made up quizzes until noon on Wednesday 4-8-2020.
