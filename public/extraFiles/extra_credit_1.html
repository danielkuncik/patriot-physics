<ol>
    <li>
        In Newton's Second Law,
        why are there arrows given over the variables "F" and "a"?
    </li>
    <li>
        Mr. P and his students go through a long and very formal discussion
        about why the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the force of gravity.
        Watch this, and think about it. When we do elevator problems next week,
        we will get into much more detail on this particular issue.

        Similar question:
        The force applied on a 4000 gram book is 4 N and the force of friciton is 3.6 N.
        a) Draw a free-body diagram of the book. b) Use your diagram and Newton's Second Law
        to determine the acceleration of the book.

        Which is greater, the coefficient of static friction or the coefficient of kinetic friction?
    </li>
    <li>
        Which is harder, to start something moving or to keep it moving?
    </li>
    <li>
        According to Mr. P, what is the greatest value of the coefficient of friction every recorded?
        Could you expect to see this value on a typical day?

<h3>
    3. A short self-done lab:
</h3>

<p>
    Get a really heavy box and try to push it across the floor.
    Ask yourself whether it was harder to start the box moving or keep it moving.
    To make the box moving, you must overcome maximum static friction,
    and to keep it moving you must push with a force equal to the force of kinetic friction.
    Which is stronger: the maximum static friction or the force of kinetic friction?
