<h3>
    AP Physics Homework due 9-20-19
</h3>

<p>
    What we are going to discuss on Friday are principles regarding forces and motion that are highly <i>counterintuitive</i>.
    Something is <i>counterintuitive</i> when it seems to be very simple and to make sense right away,
    but on closer examination the idea you thought was true is incorrect!
    In particular, we are going to examine the highly counterintuitive idea that force does not cause motion, it cases changes in motion.

    Re-read chapter 15 and 16, of The Clockwork Universe by Edward Dolnick. (pages 90 - 102).
    [They are called <i>A Play Without and Audience</i> and <i>All in Pieces</i>.
    This chapter discusses how early physicists such as Newton and Galileo disproved ideas that had been seen as common sense,
    obvious facts for centuries. Answer the following questions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The ancient Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle,
        pointed out differences between two different universes: the cosmos, and here on earth.
        What were the differences they saw?
    </li>
    <li>
        How did Galileo's approach differ from Aristotle's?
    </li>
    <li>
        What Polish thinker first posited that the earth is is constant motion?
    </li>
    <li>
        Copernicus's model faced two major hurdles: it seemd to violate religious ideas and it seemed to violate common sense.
        Focus on the commonsense arguments against the model that the earth moves.
        What were they?
    </li>
    <li>
        In order to explain the perfect, unending motion of planets, the Ancient Greeks devised a system
        in which planets moved in circles inside of circles. Why did they need to do this? Why didn't the planets
        just move around in a circle?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the mathematical advantages of Copernicus's heliocentric
        theory over the Ancient Greek's circles inside of circles theory?
    </li>
</ol>

    The other readings are from a website called <a href = 'https://www.physicsclassroom.com'>The Physics Classroom</a>.
    On this website, you can look up descriptions of every topic we study,
    and also some extra problems. Today, we'll look at three articles.
</p>

<a href = 'https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Newton-s-First-Law'>The Physics Classroom: Newton's First Law</a>
<br>
<a href = 'https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Inertia-and-Mass'>The Physics Classroom: Inertia and Mass</a>
<br>
<a href = 'https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-3/The-Big-Misconception'>The Physics Classroom: The Big Misconception</a>

<ol>
    <li>
        Copy Newton's First Law. This is one we will need to memorize word for word. (As well as how to use it.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Imagine you are sledding down a hill and then onto a long, flat surface.
        According to Galileo,
        how would you move if friction (and all other forces) could be eliminated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes in motion are always caused by forces.
        What force typically makes things stop moving and come to rest?
    </li>
    <li>
        Inertia is resistance to changes in motion.
        What quantity determines how much inertia an object has?
    </li>
    <li>
        The author of the website calls this "The Big Misconception":
        If an object has a net force acting on it of zero, then the object must be not moving.
        In fact, Newton's First Law states that an object with zero net force acting on it
        can be moving at a constant velocity (constant speed and constant direction).
        Come up with two examples of objects that have a nonzero net force acting on them but ARE moving.
    </li>
    <li>
        True or false: to continue moving, a force must continue to push you?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    What the author says about physics is correct: you need to consistently think about it in order to understand it!
    I recommend you keep coming back to these readings as you understand Newton's Laws better.
