<!--
focus on the problems on static and kinetic friction from flipping physics

plus maybe some reading from the textbook

plus some of my problems
-->

<h1>
    Homework Due 10-8-19
</h1>

<p>
    There are three parts to the homework:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First some practice problems similar to those we did in class today.
    </li>
    <li>
        Second, watching three flipping physics videos and answering questions on them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Third, a brief do-it-yourself experiment.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>
    1. Practice Problems
    <a href = '/unit/mechanics/dynamics_math'>Quantitative Dynamics Problems:</a> Please complete sections E and F and check your answers

</h3>


<h3>
    2. Flipping Physics Videos
</h3>

<h4>
    Flipping Physics Newton's Second Law Video:

<ol>
    <li>
        In Newton's Second Law,
        why are there arrows given over the variables "F" and "a"?
    </li>
    <li>
        Mr. P and his students go through a long and very formal discussion
        about why the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the force of gravity.
        Watch this, and think about it. When we do elevator problems next week,
        we will get into much more detail on this particular issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Similar question:
        The force applied on a 4000 gram book is 4 N and the force of friciton is 3.6 N.
        a) Draw a free-body diagram of the book. b) Use your diagram and Newton's Second Law
        to determine the acceleration of the book.
    </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>
        Why does friction occur?
    </li>
    <li>
        How can you make the force of friction stronger?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is friction a vector or a scalar?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the difference between static and kinetic friction?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the magnitude of friction depend on surface area?
    </li>
    <li>
        What direction does the force of friction act?
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>

</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        What are the units of the coefficient of friction?
    </li>
    <li>
        What determines what the coefficient of kinetic friction will be?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the best way to know what the coefficient of friction is?
    </li>
    <li>
        Which is greater, the coefficient of static friction or the coefficient of kinetic friction?
    </li>
    <li>
        Which is harder, to start something moving or to keep it moving?
    </li>
    <li>
        According to Mr. P, what is the greatest value of the coefficient of friction every recorded?
        Could you expect to see this value on a typical day?
    </li>
</ol>



<h3>
    3. A short self-done lab:
</h3>

<p>
    Get a really heavy box and try to push it across the floor.
    Ask yourself whether it was harder to start the box moving or keep it moving.
    To make the box moving, you must overcome maximum static friction,
    and to keep it moving you must push with a force equal to the force of kinetic friction.
    Which is stronger: the maximum static friction or the force of kinetic friction?
