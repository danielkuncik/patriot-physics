<h4>
    Extra Credit Assignment for Honors and Physics A: April 2020.
</h4>


<p>
    Hello everybody.
    Because of all of the unpredictable events over the few weeks,
    the term is about to end, and some people have a grade lower than they would expect.
    There are two ways to improve this.
    one is to take the quizzes, which are now all open, and email them to me.
    The other is to complete this assignment.
</p>

<p>
    The assignments are based on Flipping Physics, which is a set of physics videos
    made by a physics teacher in Michigan.
    You can watch the videos, and then answer the questions,
    then turn them in via email.
    You can turn in a typed copy of the answers, or you can handwrite the answers, take a photo,
    and then send me the photo.
</p>

<p>
    For each assignment you complete well, you will receive 5 extra points in PowerSchool.
    (Those are five points averaged in with all other assignments, not five points towards you grade overall.)
    I was originally planning to add four assignments.
    However, after three, students' grades are in a very healthy place, so I am sticking to 3.
</p>

    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    I will accept this assignment via email until noon on Thursday 4-9-2020.
</p>
<p>
    I will accept made up quizzes until noon on Wednesday 4-8-2020.
</p>


<p>
    I will update all grades except the extra credit by noon on Thursday: 4-2-2020,
    so you have one week to determine what you need to do.
