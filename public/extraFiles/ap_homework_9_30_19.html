<h3>
    AP Homework due 9-30-19
</h3>

<p>
    Several of these problems deal with the topic of terminal velocity,
    but remember that terminal velocity itself isn't a topic on the AP test.
    The topic that's on the AP test is how to connect free-body diagrams
    to the motion of an object.
    Terminal velocity is one interesting case of this because it is a case
    when an object is moving very fast transitions from accelerating
    to moving at a constant velocity. Understanding the free-body diagrams
    relevant free-body diagrams are key.
</p>

<p>
    Read each of these articles about people have have survived free-fall from incredible heights.
</p>

<a href = 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/nyregion/04fall.html'>Alcides Moreno</a> was a New York City
window washer who fell from 47 stories up and lived.
<a href = 'https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17476615'>Juliane Koepcke</a> survived a fall from a plane at
an altitude of 2 miles.

<ol>
    <li>
        From the article on Alcides Moreno, his wife says “He was trained,” she said “He knew what to do with the platform”
        — meaning, according to other window washers, lie flat and ride it down.
        Using what you know about air resistance, explain how this could help Mr. Moreno live.
    </li>
    <li>
        from the article on Juliane Koepcke, she says "Suddenly the noise stopped and I was outside the plane.
        I was in a freefall, strapped to my seat bench and hanging head-over-heels."
        Using what you know about air resistance, explain how this fact could have helped her live.
    </li>
    <li>
        People in free-fall accelerate, but as they experience more air resistance they stop accelerating.
        Draw a free-body diagram of a person the instant they begin to fall,
        and then draw another free-body diagram of the same person after they have been falling for several seconds.
        Analyze each of the free-body diagrams by referring to Newton's Model (given in the table above).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    These videos from from a classic Mythbusters episodes: The Penny Drop.
    The myth is that a penny that flies off the top if the Empire State Building
    could break a person's skull.
    Spoiler Alert: It can't.
    There are two reasons the myth is busted.
    Only one is air resistance, but the other has quite a bit to do with physics of the penny as well.
</p>
<p>
    These two Youtube videos each show a small amount of the episode. Watch each, they overlap a little but are only about ten minutes total.
    You can answer the questions by watching these two videos.
    If you are able to sign in with your TV provider, then you can watch the whole episode <a href = 'https://go.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/full-episodes/penny-drop?'>here</a>.
    Or, you can watch it <a href = 'https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6pclum'>here</a>.

    <li>
        How do the Mythbusters simulate a penny moving at terminal velocity?
    </li>
    <li>
        Even if a penny accelerated the entire way down the Empire State Building,
        it would likely not smash somebody's skull or lodge into cement.
        Why not? Relate your answer to Newton's Second Law \( \Sigma F = ma \).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The following scene from the movie The Day After Tomorrow is quite ridiculous.

<ol start = '6'>
    <li>
        Hailstones cannot smash streetlights.
        Explain why not by referring to the same information as discussed in the Penny Drop video.
    </li>
    <li>
        Draw a set of free-body diagrams illustrating the principle above, and relate the
        answer to Newton's First and Second Laws.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Read the textbook (Giancoli) pages 76 - 83, which discuss each of Newton's Three Laws of Motion.
    Think carefully about each of the three laws of motion!
</p>

<ol start = '8'>
    <li>
        What device is used to measure force? How does it work? (We used these in class one day!)
    </li>
    <li>
        Aristotle believed that the natural state of all objects was _______________.
        Galileo believed that the natural state of all objects was ________________.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain how Galileo's idea, and Newton's First Law, apply to a book being pushed on a surface with friction.
    </li>
    <li>
        What do we call a reference frame in which Newton's First Law holds?
    </li>
    <li>
        How did Isaac Newton define mass? How does the textbook define mass?
    </li>
    <li>
        State Newton's Second Law as an equation and in words.
    </li>
    <li>
        What force is required to make an object with a mass of 4 kg accelerate at a rate of 2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the acceleration of an object with a mass of 8 kg under a force of 20 Newtons.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have you ever head "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"?
        We aren't going to use this statement in this class! It is too imprecise.
        Copy this sentence:
        "If A exerts a force on B, then B exerts a force on A with equal magnitude and opposite direciton."
        This statement will be Newton's Third Law in this class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use Newton's Third Law to explain why a skater moves backwards if they push off of a wall.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use Newton's Third Law to explain how a rocket engine works.
    </li>
</ol>
