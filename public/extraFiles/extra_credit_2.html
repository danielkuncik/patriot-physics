<ol>
    <li>
        Copy this statement three times:
        "The force on gravity acting <emph>down</emph> on earth is called the <strong>weight</strong>."
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you actually feel your weight?
    </li>
    <li>
        What force does a scale actually measure?
    </li>
    <li>
        What happens to your apparent weight when you are in an elevator going up?
    </li>
    <li>
        What happens to your apparent weight when you are free-fall (accelerating downward at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)?
    </li>

<ul>
    <li>
        How does Mr. P write Newton's Third Law as an equation?
    </li>
    <li>
        True or false?
        <ul type = 'a'>
            <li>
                A Newton's Third Law force pair acton the same object.
            </li>
            <li>
                The two forces in a Newton's Third Law force pair act on the same object.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Why doesn't Mr. P like to say that "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the official definition of a force?
    </li>
    <li>
        If a hammer strikes a nail, what are the two forces in the resulting Newton's Third Law force pair?
    </li>
    <li>
        When the kid hits the Great Wall of China, what is resulting Newton's Third Law force pair?
        If there is a force acting on the wall, why doesn't the wall move?

<ul>
    <li>
        What two forces act on the book?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the normal force and the force of gravity equal in magnitude and opposite in direction?
    </li>
    <li>
        If so, why are they <strong>not</strong> a Newton's Third Law force pair?
    </li>
    <li>
        Gravity is a result of the earth pulling on the book.
        What is the reaction force to this force?
    </li>
    <li>
        The normal force is a result of the table pushing on the book.
        What is the reaction force to this force?
    </li>
</ul>
