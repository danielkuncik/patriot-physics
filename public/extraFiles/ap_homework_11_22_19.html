    AP Homework Due 11-22-19
</h3>

<p>
    For each problem, please show clearly how you solve each problem.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        A person fires a ball directly up into the air from the ground
        at a speed of 20 m/s.
        Determine:
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                The time it takes for the ball to rise to the top of its arc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The maximum height of the ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total time that the ball is in the air.
            </li>
            <li>
                The speed at which the ball strikes the ground.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        A person is on top of a cliff that is 30 m tall
        and they throw a ball 15 m/s upward.
        Determine:
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                The maximum height of the ball <emph>without</emph>
                determining the time.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total time requires for the ball to reach the bottom of the cliff.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        A person is on top of a cliff that is 40 m tall
        and they throw a ball <emph>downward</emph>
        with a speed of 10 m/s.
        Determine:
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                The total time required for the ball to reach the bottom of the cliff.
            </li>
            <li>
                The speed at which the ball hits the floor.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        A car drives horizontally off of a cliff that is 20 m tall
        with a speed of 40 m/s.
        Please solve this problem
        by breaking it into two different dimensions:
        Determine:
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                The time that the car takes to reach the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total horizontal distance the car travels
                before reaching the ground.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        A long jumper jumps horizontally off of a roof that is 10 m tall
        with a speed of 8 m/s.
        Nobody is injured.
        Please solve this problem
        by breaking it into two different dimensions:
        Determine:
        <ol type = 'a'>
            <li>
                The time that the jumper takes to reach the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total horizontal distance the jumper travels
                before reaching the ground.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

    <li>
        What principle of physics were the Mythbusters trying to prove?
    </li>
    <li>
        What did they need to do to prove this principle?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you don't have the kinematic equations memorized perfectly,
    copy each one 5 times!
