<h3>
    AP Physics Homework Due Monday 9-16-19
</h3>

<h5>1:</h5>
Watch the following physics video:<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A05n32Bl0aY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<ol>
    <li>
        Why is the character called <i>Vector</i>?
    </li>
    <li>
        How are vectors represented?
    </li>
    <li>
        If he committed crimes with only magnitude but not direction, what would his name be?
    </li>
    <li>
        Bonus (for big Despicable Me fans): What is his real name?
    </li>
</ol>




<h5>2:</h5>
<p>
    Watch the following flipping physics video:
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/29YPIvj1zjc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<ol>
    <li>
        What does the term "normal" mean in the context of "normal force"?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does the length of an arrow in the free-body diagram represent?
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure you memorize all of these free-body diagrams! We will need to know them.
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>3:</h5>
<p>
    Watch the following flipping physics video:
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kPRD0ow-hM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<ol>
    <li>
        A rock is at rest. When we say "there are no net external forces acting on the rock,"
        what does this mean? Can there be forces acting on the rock? How so?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can an object with a net external force of zero move? If yes, how so?
    </li>
    <li>
        What precisely does it mean to have a constant velocity?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is another common name for Newton's First Law?
    </li>
    <li>
        It is a good idea to memorize the law word-for-word! We will need to know this.
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>4:</h5>
<p>
    Watch the following flipping physics video. There are no questions, but is a good review of some of the topics
    that we have been learning. Pay very close attention to the connection between the
    three graphs of motion!
</p>

<p>
We haven't learned everything on this video yet in class, we are going to come back to kinematics
after we have learned some dynamics. I want to mix up the two a little instead of doing all of the
kinematics first. But you can certainly watch the video on the topics:
Some topics in the video we haven't covered yet include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Breaking vectors into components</li>
    <li>Free-Fall Graphs and Projectile Motion</li>
    <li>Relative Motion</li>
    <li>Center of Mass</li>
</ul>
<p>When Mr. P says "the vacuum you can breath," he just means that we are ignoring air resistance.</p>
<p>
    If you want to see a copy of the AP Physics 1 equation sheet, look <a href = 'https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-physics-1-equations-table.pdf'>here</a>.
    Mr. P points out some of the complications with the presentation of the kinematic equations.
    For example, that initial time is assumed to be zero, and one equation is missing.
</p>


<h5>5:</h5>
<p>
    If you are planning to take the Level 5 quizzes next week (required to get an A),
    watch the following video on the derivations of the kinematic equations.
    There are no questions on the video, but you will need to know the content in this video
    to explain the derivation of the equations graphically.
