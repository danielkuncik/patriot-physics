        An cannon fires an object with a speed of 25 m/s
        at an angle of 18 degrees up from the ground.
        Ignore air resistance in solving this problem.
        The cannon is located on the ground when it fires the object.
        Determine the range of the cannonball: how far it travels before
        striking the ground by following these steps.
        <ul type = 'a'>
            <li>
                What is the initial horizontal and vertical speed of the cannonball?
            </li>
            <li>
                Describe the motion of the cannonball in the horizontal dimension.
                What equation can be used to quantitatively analyze this motion?
            </li>
            <li>
                Describe the motion of the cannonball in the vertical dimension.
                What equation<strong>s</strong> can be used to quantitatively analyze this motion?
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the time that the cannonball is in the air before striking the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the range that the cannonball travels before striking the ground.

        An super-cannon on the moon fires an object with a speed of 120 m/s
        at an angle of 15 degrees up from the ground.
        There is no air on the moon, so there is no air resistance.
        The cannon is located on the ground when it fires the object.
        Determine the range of the cannonball: how far it travels before
        striking the ground.
        <ul type = 'a'>
            <li>
                Look up online the free-fall acceleration on the moon.
                This number replaces 9.8 in your analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the initial horizontal and vertical speed of the cannonball?

            <li>
                Describe the motion of the cannonball in the horizontal dimension.
                What equation can be used to quantitatively analyze this motion?
