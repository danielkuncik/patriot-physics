<p>
    Click <a href = 'https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html'>this link</a> and look at the image of a <strong>transverse wave</strong>.
    It is the second link on the list:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Which direction is the wave moving?
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify a single particle.
        This is one of the single dots.
        Describe the motion of that dot?
        In particular, as the wave moves through,
        the particle moves, but does not travel with the wave.
        What does it do?
    </li>
    <li>
        Compare the motion of that dot and the wave
        to the motion of a single person as the wave moves across a stadium.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    (Also, read the little note next to the wave. It explains the same concept.)

<p>
    Now, read pages 305 - 307 (section 11-7)
    This was a part of the weekend reading,
    but focus exclusively on these pages
    and try to understand them very well.
    In particular, focus on the images of waves
    within a rope as the person shakes the rope.
    These show the same concept of wave and particle
    motion illustrated on the website.
