<h3>
    AP Homework due 10-2-19
</h3>

<p>
    For each of the four quizzes that are circled on your page, complete
    the necessary practice work.
    Note that the assignment will be different for each student.
    You can find a link to the work <a href = '/unit/mechanics/vector_force_analysis'>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    On Wednesday, you will take each of the quizzes that is circled on your page.
    This will not be the last time we take on these quizzes, but we will move
    to new content in class.
    If you want to take more quizzes than the four that are circled, you can
    as long as you promise you have studied for them.
</p>

<p>
    All quizzes that are levels 1 and 2 you will take <emph>at home</emph>.
    All quizzes that are levels 3 and 4 you will take <emph>in class</emph>.
    Some level 5 quizzes you will take at home, and some in class, depending on the quiz,
    and all level 6 quizzes are problem sets that you can work on at home
    with others and with open notes.
</p>

<p>
    Not all of the links are currently active, but I will make them all active by the end of tonight.
</p>

<p>
    Make sure you check you work! I included answers with each problem.
