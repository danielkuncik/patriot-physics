<p>
    Please complete the materials on elevator problems from class on Thursday.
    Your should study for the quiz on Wednesday by reviewing material on
    <a href = '/unit/dynamics/dynamics_math'>quantitative dynamics</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The only topic we have not yet covered in class is static friction.
    Watch the following video on a static friction problem, and make sure that you think about the problem.
    I may add other videos on static friction over the course of the weekend.
