<p>
    If you haven't already, watch the video "The Private Universe" and answer two questions:

        At one point, one of the participants shouts "OWW!" What happened? Why?
    </li>
    <li>
        One of the students says, "You don't have a current if you have only one wire. You need to complete a closed circuit."
        <ul>
            <li>
                What element(s) of her reasoning is/are correct and why?
            </li>
            <li>
                What element(s) of her reasoning is/are incorrect and why?

        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

    There will be a quiz on Tuesday on using the conservation of energy to analyze falling down objects.
    Please try to do your best the first time so that you are able to move to more complicated problems
    on work and energy. To study, please complete falling problems 1, 3, and 4.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href = '/contentFiles/energy_files/falling_probs_1.pdf'>Falling Problems 1: required</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = '/contentFiles/energy_files/falling_probs_2.pdf'>Falling Problems 2: optional, if you want more practice</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = '/contentFiles/energy_files/falling_probs_3.pdf'>Falling Problems 3: required</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = '/contentFiles/energy_files/falling_probs_4.pdf'>Falling Problems 4: required</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = '/contentFiles/energy_files/falling_probs_5.pdf'>Falling Problems 5: highly recommended if you want a high score</a>
        (We don't have much more than a week to spend on these problems, so learn it now not later.)
    </li>
    <li>
        And make sure you have the conservation of energy memorized word for word!
        "Energy cannot be created or destroyed. IT can only be transferred between forms."
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Finally, complete the "Lazy Donkey Paradox" page completely. We didn't take time to explicitly answer every question
    in class, so I'm assuming you have some but not all of it done.
