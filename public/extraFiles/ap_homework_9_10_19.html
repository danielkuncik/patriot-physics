        Complete the analysis for the lab assignment:
        <ul>
            <li>If you have done the measurements of the falling tennis ball, use them to calcualte the value of <i>g</i></li>.
            <li>If you have measured the speed of the two tumble buggie cars, use them to predict the spot where they would collide if facing each other.</li>
            <li>If you have taken measurements for the car going down the ramp, use it to make a graph and calculate acceleration.</li>
        </ul>
        The assignment is avialable <a href = './kinematics_labs.pdf'>here!</a>
    </li>

        You are going to watch a video and then answer a few questions about it.
        Pick a video based on how confident you are about your quiz.
        You only need to watch one of the videos, not both.
        If you feel like you want more review, do the first one.
        If you want to move on to tougher probelms, do the second one:

                Level 3 Problem Video:

                Questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Can you use the UAM equations in this problem (which I usually call the <i>kinematic equations</i>)? Why?</li>
                    <li>Why can't you just plug the given numbers into this equation?</li>
                    <li>
                        Complete the same problem, but with slightly different numbers. Note that I took the conversion out:
                        Mr. P is riding his bike at 4.50 m/s when he applies the brakes causing his bike to slow down
                        with a constant acceleration. After 3.01 seconds he has traveled 6.00 meters.
                        A) What was his acceleration and
                        B) What was his final speed?

                Questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        What is the point of the subscripts in the problem?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the point of writing <i>Î”t</i> instead of <i>t</i>?
                    </li>
                    <li>Can you use the UAM equations in this problem (which I usually call the <i>kinematic equations</i>)? Why?</li>
                    <li>
                        How do they find the initial velocity for part 2?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Why can't the displacement be found with one single equation?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complete the same problem with different numbers.
                        A toy car starts from rest and experiences an acceleration of 2.03 m/s2 for 1.3 seconds, and then brakes for 1.2 seconds and experiences an acceleration of -1.76 m/s2.
                        a) How fast is the car going at the end of the braking period?
                        b) How far has it moved?
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
