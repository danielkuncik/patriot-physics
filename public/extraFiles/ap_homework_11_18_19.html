<h3>
    AP Homework
</h3>

<p>
    Read Chapter 6 of the Giancoli textbook.
    on the Conservation of Energy
    and the Work-Energy theorem.
</p>

<p>
    On page 148, the formulas presented for Hooke's Law
    and elastic potential energy are presented differently
    than I did.
    They assume that the zero position (the horizontal position of the origin)
    is the equilibrium length of the spring.
</p>

<p>
    Answer the following questions from the end of the chapter:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Page 164, #13:
        in this problem, note that the WORK done in a particular
        interval is the <emph>area underneath the curve</emph>
        of the Force-position graph for that interval.
    </li>
    <li>
        Page 165 #38
    </li>
    <li>
        Page 167 #72.
        The kinetic energy of the train is transferred in to the elastic
        potential energy of the spidey-string.
        Assume the spidey-string has an equilibrium length of zero.
