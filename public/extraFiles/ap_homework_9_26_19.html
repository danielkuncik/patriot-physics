<h3>
    AP Homework Due 9-26-19
</h3>

<p>
    The assignment, and the lab for the next class period,
    will come from the <a href = 'https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/physics'>Phet Physics Simulations</a>

<h4>
    Part 1: The Lunar Lander
</h4>

<iframe src="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/lunar-lander/lunar-lander_en.html" width="800" height="600" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
    The goal of the game is to use your thruster effectively to try to make the lunar lander land!
    Keep playing until you win consistently. Also try some ideas that make you crash land.
</p>

<h5>
    Questions
</h5>
<p>
    Do your best to asnwer the questions with physics words such as <i>accelerate</i>.
    Also think about how you can connect these qusetions to Newton's Laws and Newton's Model.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        If you never turn on the thurster, what does the lander do?
    </li>
    <li>
        If the lander is moving downard and you turn on the thruster, what does the lander do?
    </li>
    <li>
        You can't win just by blowing the thruster all the time. Why not?
    </li>
    <li>
        Making the lander go up far is not a good strategy. Why not?
    </li>
    <li>
        How can you get the lander to fall at a constant velocity?
    </li>
    <li>
        The goal is to have the softest landing possible. Mr. Kuncik's best is 0.6 m/s. Can you beat it?
    </li>
    <li>
        I think the other goal is to get it to land at range = 0.
        (At the start, range = 45 m). This means that you need to move horizontally as well as vertically.
        Can you do it?
    </li>

</ol>

<h3>
    The Maze Game
</h3>

<p>
    The maze game is a java applet. You need to downlaod it and run from your computer.
    Your computer might not be able to do this. (I don't think chromebooks can).
    If so, try to find someone who can play it.

    If it doesn't work, that's okay. Focus on getting very good at the lunar lander game.

<ol>
    <li>
        First, the control arrow to position (R).
        This is pretty simple, just click in the correct spot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, set the control arrow to velocity (V).
        Still intuitive, but harder. This is how most normal video games work.
        You can still make it go exactly where you want it to.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, set the control arrow to acceleration (A).
        This is very very hard.
        Can you think of any strategies to help make it possible?
    </li>
    <li>
        Of these three, which one do you actually control by exerting a <i>force</i> in physics?
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on these games, is it easy to fly a spaceship? (the answer is no, but say why not?
    </li>
</ol>
