<p>
    Here's some book work!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Read Chapter 2. This is a review of old material on
        1 -dimensional kinematics.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Page 45 #50
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Read Pages 58 - 63. (Chapter 3)
        This content is on projectile motion, the most recent topic we have covered.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Look at Figure 3-19 on page 59.
                Relate this photo to the question about the bullet drop.
                That is: the ball that is dropped vertically and the one pushed horizontally
                strike the ground at precisely the same time.
                Explain why by examining this photo.

    </li>
    <li>
        Read pages 170 - 181 (Chapter 7).
        This is material on the conservation of momentum,
