<h3>
    AP Physics 1 Extra Credit Assignment for Quarter 3
    <br>
    April, 2020
</h3>

<p>
    Hello everybody!
</p>

<p>
    Due to the events of the past few weeks,
    the term is ending abruptly and some people's grade is lower
    than would be normal.
    To that end, I am adding extra credit assignments.
    For each assignment you complete, you earn 5 extra points in power school (not points on your grade,
    points in the average).
    You can earn a total of 42 points!
</p>

<p>
    Note that all assignments except this extra credit assignment will be posted by Thursday 4-2-2020 at noon.
</p>

<p>
    The assignment is to watch the <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGgviqq4847W5Jc1K3o99YHTGLx-L75m'>lessons that the College Board is presenting each day</a>,
    take notes, and work through a physics problem.
</p>

<h5>
    Requirements
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        Watch the full lesson
    </li>
    <li>
        Take at last 8 notes of points relevant to the content on AP physics.
        Do not take notes on the format of the test etc, only on the content being taught.
        And don't write down the first 8 things that are said, spread your notes throughout
        so it is clear you watched the full lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete the problem that is presented at the end of the lesson.
        There is always a problem given at the end.
        If it is open response, complete it as is.
        If it is multiple choice, pick the correct answer and explain you choice
        in about 3 sentences.
        If you need help, they always solve the problem at the beginning of the next lesson,
        but please try your best to complete by yourself first.
        Or, better yet, work on it with a friend in a Google Hangout.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Please hand write your responses, take a photo on your phone, and email it to me.
    You will receive 5 points for each lecture you watch and take notes on,
    up to 40 total points if you watch every lecture 1 - 8.
    The lectures are presented live each day at noon, and remain visible <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGgviqq4847W5Jc1K3o99YHTGLx-L75m'>on the AP Physics 1 channel</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You can earn 2 extra points for answering the following questions.
    But you need to finish the other assignments, you cannot get just these two points.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In what state does Greg Jacobs teach?
    </li>
    <li>
        In what state does Joshua Beck teach?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who is Edna?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I will accept these assignments via email until noon on Thursday, 4-9-2020.
    I will accept quiz makeups via email until noon on Wednesday, 4-8-2020.
</p>
