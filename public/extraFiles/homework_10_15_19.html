<p>Answer the following questions</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        What two scientists discovered the battery?
    </li>
    <li>
        How did Alessandro Volta create the first battery?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does it mean to <emph>oxidize</emph>? Which material oxidizes in Volta's battery?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does it mean to <emph>reduce</emph>? Which material reduces in Volta's battery?
    </li>
    <li>
        What did Volta think reacted with the zinc? What actually reacts with the zinc?
    </li>
    <li>
        When does a battery die?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Watch the following video on batteries until at least 4:30.
    This video is from a chemistry curriculum
    so it includes many chemical equations.
    You do not need to know these specific chemical equations,
    but you do need to know that a battery works due to a chemical reaction.
    You also do not need to know about the standard reduction potential.

<ul start = '7'>
    <li>
        What is the <strong>anode</strong>?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the <strong>cathode</strong>?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why do the anode and cathode need to be separated from each other for the battery to work?
    </li>
    <li>
        Which direction do the electrons flow? Anode to cathode <emph>or</emph> cathode to anode?
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Please turn the answers in to your folder the next day we have class.
