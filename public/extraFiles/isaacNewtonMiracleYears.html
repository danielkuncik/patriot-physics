<h3>
    Isaac Newton's Miracle Years
</h3>

<p>
    In the year 1665, Isaac Newton was a largely unnoticed student at University of Cambridge.
    He came from a family of yeoman farmers. They were wealthy enough to own a farm,
    but were not in the English nobility with a large estate and many tenants, roughly the equivalent of
    today’s upper-middle class. Seeing that, as a child and an adolescent, Isaac was always wandering
    around in thought and seemed incredibly uninterested in farming, his family sent him to Cambridge University.
</p>

<p>
    As a teenager, Isaac Newton began forming his own philosophy based on observation.
    Like many inquisitive people he had a big notebook of questions and answers,
    or at least his best attempt at answers. For example, he asked himself,
    “Are things composed of continuous material, or tiny bits?” and did his best to arrive at an answer.
    Of course, today we know that material is composed of tiny pieces called atoms. Newton had no way of knowing this,
    but he did his best to make rational arguments based on what he observed about the world around him.
</p>

<p>
    At that time, very very few people went to University.
    The vast majority of the population were farmers, and it had no relevance to them.
    Even people in subjects that today would require university training, such as medicine,
    law, and banking, mostly learned their trades in apprenticeships, not universities.
    Universities did not provide any practical knowledge. The primary department of each university was theology,
    the study of religious questions, and their primary function was to train members of the clergy.
</p>

<p>
    Science, as we understand it, barely existed.
    Science consists of making observations of the natural world and then
    creating theories that explain and predict these observations.
    This was not how medieval universities functioned. The primary method that existed
    at medieval universities was called scholasticism. In scholasticism, the professor would ask question,
    and students would answer by referring to old texts. For example, if the question was “how was the universe created?”
    And the students would quote information from the Bible, information from famous Greek and Roman philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, and Pliny, information from other medieval scholastic writers, etc, then try to conclude some sort of an answer.
    All of the information was based on analysis of older texts, rather than observation.
</p>

<p>
    Francis Bacon, one of the early advocates of science,
    told a famous parody of scholasticism. Several of the leading minds
    of the day were arguing about how many teeth a horse had. They were arguing
    by trying to cite one famous book or another on horses. Finally, somebody in the room said,
    “Well, there’s a horse outside! why don’t we just count its teeth?” This man was then instantly and forever cast out of the society of learned men.
</p>

<p>
    However, by the time Isaac Newton arrived at Cambridge,
    science ready to bloom. In Italy, the Polish born astronomer Copernicus and
    the Pisan mathematician Galileo argued that the earth revolves around the sun.
    Galileo also explained the motion of pendulums and created precise models of how an
    object moves in when it is thrown in the air. In Denmark, an astronomer named
    Tycho Brae observed the sky every night for decades and created a treasure trove of observations.
    A student of his named Johannes Kepler used these records to create mathematical laws
    describing the orbits of stars. The world was ripe for a new kind of thinking.
</p>

<p>
    Isaac Newton arrived at Cambridge shortly after these scientists completed their work.
    He was unremarkable. He did not win awards, he was not any professor’s favorite,
    few knew anything about him. When he was in the middle of his studies, in the year 1665, there was a plague.
</p>


<p>
    Plague was a common occurrence in world history until only about 100 years ago.
    The most famous was the Black Death of the 1340s that killed more than half the population of Europe,
    but as time progressed, every several years there was another outbreak. Nobody understood germs or exponential growth models,
    or knew how to “flatten the curve.” Many people believed that plagues were God’s anger, or were sent to remind humans of their short existence.
    Astrologers would try to predict occurrences based on the motion of stars and planets or the emergence of comets.
    Even today, doctors and epidemiologists still debate what caused these early plagues.
    The plague of 1665 and 1666 in London killed 100,000 people in 18 months.
    People’s best explanation was that “1666” was the devil’s year.
</p>

<p>
    As a result of the plague outbreak, Cambridge University closed,
    and Isaac Newton returned to his mother’s farm to “social distance”.
    I highly doubt that Cambridge provided him with a distance learning plan.
    It was at this time, alone, with no duties and nothing to do, that Isaac Newton had
    what are called his “miracle years.” Through his own thoughts and observations, he discovered his law of gravity,
    his three laws of motion, the principles of calculus, and that white light is composed of every color of light!
    All while waiting on his mother’s farm for school to reopen.
</p>


<p>
    The most common story about Isaac Newton was that he was
    struck on the head by an apple and discovered that an apple falls due to gravity.
    This is almost certainly apocryphal (not true). Do you think that you would be likely
    to make a world changing revelation after you’ve been smacked in the head? No. What is true is that
    Newton asked himself why the moon orbits the earth. He realized that it was the same force that made the apple fall.
    He figured that he could describe both forces mathematically: the force that makes an apple fall and the force that
    keeps the moon in orbit can be explained by the same formula! This was the birth of the his Law of Universal Gravitation.
</p>


<p>
    Strangely, and Newton was extremely strange,
    he didn’t tell anyone what he had discovered for
    about 20 years, at which time he was encouraged to
    publish his work by another scientist named Edmund Halley.
    In the meantime, a German mathematician working in France
    named Gottfried Leibniz also discovered the principles of calculus,
    forcing Newton to take only half the credit for one of his greatest discoveries.
    (If you have a Calculus textbook, open up the first chapter.
    The first chapter of most calculus textbooks will discusses Newton, Leibniz, and their classic feud.)
</p>

<p>
    After Isaac Newton published his work in a book in latin called the
    <emph>Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</emph>
    (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, usually referred to as “The Principia”),
    the world was forever changed. Newton became a worldwide celebrity
    (though he continued to live alone not talk to anyone, and there was no plague
    outbreak to use an an excuse). Most people had not read his books or examined his theories,
    but what they knew was that Isaac Newton had explained why things happen, and that he did so
    by observing , asking questions, and creating mathematical models, not by reading old books.
    People stopped trying to predict what was going to happen based on the stars and planets, or
    the number of the year. In fact, now that the motion of stars and planets were described by Newton’s
    Law of Gravity, stars and planets couldn’t be responsible for a plague. Instead, people asked questions,
    observed, ran experiments, and designed mathematical knowledge The poet Alexander Pope wrote this famous Couplet:
    <br>
    “Nature and nature’s laws lay hid in the night.
    <br>
    God said, Let Newton be! And all as light!”
    <br>
    Isaac Newton was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside the Kings and Queens of England.

</p>

<p>
    In the following decades, during a historical period
    called the Enlightenment, a major change occurred at universities
    and in the minds of intellectuals. Scholasticism began falling out of
    favor, and scientific research took its place. Instead of comparing thoughts
    of ancient authors, scientists working in universities observed the world around
    them and created mathematical models to describe what was happening. No longer did
    people believe that the stars and planets are beings following their own courses,
    but instead understood them as bodies whose orbits can be predicted by the force of
    gravity using the Laws that Isaac Newton invented. Physics was the first science to explode,
    and other sciences soon followed: chemistry, biology, geology, medicine, and, in time, virology and epidemiology.

</p>


<p>
    Think about how the scientific and government authorities have been discussing the coronavirus
    in the past few months. Not everyone agrees on the best methods, but the entire world believes this about coronavirus:
    If we can understand it, if we can model it, and if we can figure out how it moves, then we can eventually control it.
    Now, of course, this is biology, not physics, but it is a prime example of the world basing its hopes of scientific thinking.
</p>


<p>
    In 1665, when plague struck London, people believed it might have been caused
    by the motion of planets, God’s wrath, or the number of the year. They tried to
    explain it by comparing centuries philosophical texts. But the emergency of science
    fundamentally changed how humans approach any new challenge, and today the coronavirus is
    understood in terms of DNA, proteins, and epidemiological models.
</p>

<p>
    And science’s first great leap forward was made by a social distancing college kid.
