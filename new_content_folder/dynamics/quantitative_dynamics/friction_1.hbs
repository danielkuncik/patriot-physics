    Friction is one of the most crucial forces in physics.
    Friction keeps objects in place.
    Friction stops objects from moving.
    It is the force behind the breaks on your car,
    and it is the force that allows you to stand up without falling down.
    Any understanding of dynamics is incomplete without a thorough understanding
    of friction.
</p>

<p>
    In this pod dealing with basic friction,
    we will introduce the two types of friction:
    <strong>static friction</strong>
    and <strong>kinetic friction</strong>.
    Here, we will discuss the definition of each one,
    and later on we will use both static friction and
    kinetic friction quantitatively.
</p>

<p>
    The following definitions
    of static and kinetic friction applies
    to a block sliding on a flat surface.

<p class = 'definition'>
    The force of <strong>kinetic friction</strong>
    affects the block when it is moving.
    It works to make the block stop moving.
</p>

<p class = 'definition'>
    The force of <strong>static friction</strong>
    affects the block when it is not moving.
    It works to prevent the block from beginning to move.

    Bob the Builder
    is trying to push a big heavy box.
    The box isn't moving.
    He pushes and pushes,
    but it still doesn't move.
    He is pushing against a force called
    <li class = 'question'>___________________</li> friction.
    Finally, Bob pushes harder than the
    <li class = 'question'>___________________</li> static friction
    and the box begins to move.
    Now, box has to keep the box moving,
    to do this, he needs to push against a force called
    <li class = 'question'>___________________</li> friction.
    Fortunately, he does not need to push as hard because
    kinetic friction is
    <li class = 'question'>___________________</li> than
    maximum static friction.

<h5>
    Written Question:
</h5>
<ol class = 'questionList'>
    <li class = 'question'>
        Try pushing a big heavy box across the floor.
        It needs to slide, it cannot have wheels.
        Ask yourself, which takes more force:
        getting the block to start moving,
        or keeping it moving.
        According to the rules of friction,
        it always takes more force to get it started moving
        than to keep the object moving.
        See if, by closely examining how it feels to push the heavy box,
        you can observe this effect yourself.

        Use the concepts of static and kinetic friction
        to explain why it should be easier to begin moving
        the box than to keep it moving?

<h3>
    Guidelines for Writing About Forces
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When writing about forces, always write that
        "the force acts on the box."
        Never write that the box "has" a force.
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>
                GOOD: Gravity acts on the box.
            </li>
            <li>
                BAD: The box has gravity.
            </li>
            <li>
                GOOD: When the box is moving, kinetic friction acts on the box.
            </li>
            <li>
                BAD: When the box is moving, it has kinetic friction.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't use the terms "energy" and "momentum" when writing about forces.
        These are different concepts that apply to different unit.
        Don't use these terms unless you are sure that you know what they mean,
        and you are using them appropriately.
        <ul>
            <li>
                GOOD: It takes more force to start the box moving than to keep it moving.
            </li>
            <li>
                BAD It takes more energy to start the box moving than to keep it moving.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not anthropomorphize forces. To "anthropomorphize" means that you
        give human qualities to something that is not human.
        <ul>
            <li>
                BAD: Kinetic friction tries to stop an object that is moving.
            </li>
            <li>
                GOOD: Kinetic friction acts on an object in a way that stops its motion.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
