Do
- collect at least 18 data points
- use at least 6 different values of the indepedent variable
- the greatest value of the independent variable should 4x the least value (or greater)


Don't
- average measurements (instead, consider)
- use too small values of the independent variable
- use too great values of the independent variable


It's ok to:
- have more than one datum at the same value of the independent variable
- not collect data in even intervals
