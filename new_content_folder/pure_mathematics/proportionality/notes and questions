I still have some concerns with this unit

- should equation proportioality be broken in two...
one including oly direct and inverse and the others including all types of proportionality?
[my best guess is YES]

- should this unit be moevd to 'science practices?'
[a little proportionality pod can be added to the algebra unit, but really, this unit
is about how proporttionality connects to equations, not pure mathematics]

- I need to include the proportinality formula in the numeric problems

X_1 / X-2 = Y-1 / Y2
(taht stuff)

[this should also be inclued in a pod in the algebra unit]
