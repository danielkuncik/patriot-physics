<p>
    In all of the sections thus far,
    we have examined collisions quantitatively using
    tables to organize our information.
    As you might have expected, professional physicists use large equations
    in order to quantitatively explain collisions.
    A main goal of level 3 is to work from using tables to using equations.
    However, it is crucial when using equations to not merely plug information
    into a memorized equation but to be able to explain where an equation is derived from
    and what each term of that equation means.
    The goal of this section is to continue using tables in order to derive
    equations, and to examine the individual terms of those equations.

    <li class="question">
        A cannon of mass \( m_1 \) is attached to the roof of a car of mass \( m_2 \).
        Inside the cannon is a cannonball of mass \( m_3 \).
        The car is driving at a velocity of \( v_{\text{i}} \).
        The cannon fires and the cannonball moves at a velocity \( v_{3 \text{f}} \).
        Assume that the cannon and car do not become detached,
        and after the explosion they both move at the speed \( v_{2 \text{f}} \).

            <li class="subQuestion" data-answer = '\( \left( m_1 + m_2 + m_3 \right)v_i = \left( m_1 + m_2 \right) v_{2 \text{f}} + m_3 v_{3 \text{f}} \)'>

        (<strong>Something to think about</strong>:
        There isn't any information in this problem or in your formula
        about the direction that anything is moving. We don't know if the cannonball
        was fired in the same direction the car was moving; we also don't know if the car
        speed up, slowed down, or reversed direction.
        All of this information would be contained in the positive and negative signs of the
        velocity variables \( v_{\text{i}} \), \( v_{3 \text{f}} \), and \( v_{2 \text{f}} \).
        The formula is identical regardless of the direction of each item.)
    </li>

    <li class="question" data-answer = '\( m_a v_{ai} + m_b v_{bi} = (m_a - m_p) v_{af} + m_b v_{bf} + m_p v_p \)'>
        A car (A) of mass \( m_a \) moving at a velocity \( v_{ai} \) collides into another car (B)
        of mass \( m_b \) moving at velocity \( v_{bi} \).
        Following the collision, car A moves with velocity \( v_{af} \)
        and car B moves with velocity \( v_{bf} \).
        However, a piece of car A of mass \( m_p \) breaks off of car A and
        begins moving at velocity \( v_p \).
        Determine an equation with 5 terms that relates each of the 8 variables defined above.
        <br><br>
        Remember, once again, that directional information is not included in the formula.
        We don't know if the collision was rear-end or head-on;
        and we don't know if the piece fell forwards or backwards off of car A.
        All this information would be recognized within the velocity variables,
        not in the formula itself.
