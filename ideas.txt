Automatic Quiz Grading:


I'm going to make a new path for

/autoQuiz/{podID}
This will bring up an automatically grading quiz, if it is available
- if not available, it redirects to the home page


Step 1
- add a search to see if an automatic quiz exists
- add a path to open the automatic quiz
- the view page will be a stub for now, but make that stub

Step 2
- create a system of generating the quiz from a json file
- for now, it will include only multiple choice questions in a form
- create a submit path that uploads the answers to the back end, but then just console logs them and doesn't do anything

Step 3
- you should need a login to view the automatic quiz
- when logged in, and generating the quiz, it will create redis keys with the correct answers
- it should also create a redis key indicating the quiz is active, and preventing the user form doing anything until it is complete
- when submitting the quiz, it will compare the answers submitted on the form to the answers
- all answers are kept on the back end

Step 4:
- find a way to access them??
- should i make them all accessible once they are available?



THOUGHTS
- what is the value of the 'written quiz' vs. the 'self-grading quiz'???
- where do i want each???
obviously, the written quiz is a superior test of understanding, but hand-grading every written quiz is cumbersome and unweildy
self-graded quizzes are weaker tests of understanding but are more accurate
- if i complete the physics engine, then I can use that to create much more versatile self-grading quizzes

really, this is the way forward
having written and graded quizzes is just too cumbersome
