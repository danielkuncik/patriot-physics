<h4>
    Remote Learning Assignment 6:
</h4>
<p>
    You must attempt at least 18 quizzes total. This includes the quizzes from remote learning assignments 3, 4, and 5.
    When you log in, it will say "total attempts" on your screen.
    Please do not submit the same quiz twice (some people have been doing this by accident).
</p>

<p>
    You need to complete 18 <emph>attempts</emph>, not 18 total quizzes.
    You may make you <emph>attempts</emph> in two different ways: by retaking older quizzes on which you
    did not pass, or by taking new quizzes you have not taken yet.
    Either way, you need to accumulate 18 attempts!
</p>
<p>
    Please take quizzes exclusively from these three units (for now):
    I will continue adding more quizzes and more units to the list in the coming weeks.

    Do you want to study more for the AP test?
</h4>
<p>
    I created two quizzes on AP Classroom that focus exclusively on the types
    of questions that will be on the AP test: Qualitative-Quantitative Translation
    and Short-Paragraph Response.
    All AP Classroom quizzes will be optional!
    But, if you complete them, I will score them and  give comments
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are also the live streams, and many other places to study.

<!--                The first question involves using equations to model some complex situation.-->

<!--                The second question involves writing a paragraph to explain some phenomenon.-->

<!--        Waves, Electric circuits, and electrostatics have both been taken off of the AP exam.-->
