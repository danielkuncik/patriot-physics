        Problem set 1: Mass of the sun and earth
        <ul>
            <li>
                Determine the mass of the sun by using only
                the period of the earth's revolution and the
                distance between the earth and the sun.
                Write up the solution neatly, as though it were an essay.
                For each formula you use, identify the formula,
                and explain why you are using it.
                Show several steps of algebraic manipulation.
                Diagrams are welcome.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the mass of the earth by using only
                the period of the moon's revolution and the
                distance between the earth and the moon.
                Write it up neatly as with the problem above.

        or <a href = '/pod/electric_circuits/dc_circuit_math_1/analyze_circuits_2'>PART D</a>
        on electric circuits.
        Part C we've already completed once, but it seemed in class that people
        needed to practice it more, which is okay.
        Part D is slightly tougher, so if you feel confident you understand part C,
        do part D.
        Or do both!
