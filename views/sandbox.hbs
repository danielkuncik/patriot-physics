        Draw an object that is moving in circular motion,
        then add the following to your diagram:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add an arrow indicating the centripetal force.
                Label this arrow.

            <li>
                Add an arrow indicating the instantaneous velocity at the moment

            </li>
            <li>
                Add a dotted line indicating the direction the object

    The following diagrams represent an object
    in circular motion, with the dot representing
    the current location of the object
    and the arrows representing which way it is going.
    For each situation,
    draw vectors representing the position, velocity, acceleration, and net force
    at the moment depicted.
    Depict each vector separately, not on a single diagram.

    ** Note that, in reality, it would be very unlikely that an object in a vertical
    circle would move at a constant speed. However thinking about it in this way
    can help to understand some of the physical principles involved
    without the problem becoming to complex.
</p>

<p>
    ***Note that more than two forces would be necessary to ensure the mass moved at a constant
    speed, but, as stated above, they are omitted to focus on the most important
    principles of the problem.
